1,CHAPTER 01,chapter harker keep in shorthand may munich at on may arrive at vienna early next morning should have arrive at but train be an hour late buda pesth seem a wonderful place from the glimpse which i get of it from the train and the little i could walk through the street i fear to go very far from the station as we have arrive late and would start as near the correct time as possible the impression i have be that we be leave the west and enter the east the most western of splendid bridge over the danube which be here of noble width and depth take we among the tradition of turkish rule we leave in pretty good time and come after nightfall to klausenburgh here i stop for the night at the hotel royale i have for dinner or rather supper a chicken do up some way with red pepper which be very good but thirsty mem get recipe for mina i ask the waiter and he say it be call paprika hendl and that as it be a national dish i should be able to get it anywhere along the carpathians i find my smattering of german very useful here indeed i do know how i should be able to get on without it have some time at my disposal when in london i have visit the british museum and make search among the book and map of the library regard transylvania it have strike i that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in deal with a noble of that country i find that the district he name be in the extreme east of the country just on the border of three state transylvania moldavia and bukovina in the midst of the carpathian mountain one of the wild and least know portion of europe i be not able to light on any map or work give the exact locality of the castle dracula as there be no map of this country as yet to compare with our own ordnance survey map but i find that bistritz the post town name by count dracula be a fairly well know place i shall enter here some of my note as they may refresh my memory when i talk over my travel with mina in the population of transylvania there be four distinct nationality saxon in the south and mix with they the wallachs who be the descendant of the dacians magyar in the west and szekelys in the east and north i be go among the latter who claim to be descend from attila and the huns this may be so for when the magyars conquer the country in the eleventh century they find the huns settle in it i read that every know superstition in the world be gather into the horseshoe of the carpathians as if it be the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool if so my stay may be very interesting mem i must ask the count all about they i do not sleep well though my bed be comfortable enough for i have all sort of queer dream there be a dog howl all night under my window which may have have something to do with it or it may have be the paprika for i have to drink up all the water in my carafe and be still thirsty towards morning i sleep and be waken by the continuous knocking at my door so i guess i must have be sleep soundly then i have for breakfast more paprika and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they say be mamaliga and egg plant stuff with forcemeat a very excellent dish which they call impletata mem get recipe for this also i have to hurry breakfast for the train start a little before eight or rather it ought to have do so for after rush to the station at i have to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we begin to move it seem to i that the further east you go the more unpunctual be the train what ought they to be in china all day long we seem to dawdle through a country which be full of beauty of every kind sometimes we see little town or castle on the top of steep hill such as we see in old missal sometimes we run by river and stream which seem from the wide stony margin on each side of they to be subject to great flood it take a lot of water and run strong to sweep the outside edge of a river clear at every station there be group of people sometimes crowd and in all sort of attire some of they be just like the peasant at home or those i see come through france and germany with short jacket and round hat and home make trouser but other be very picturesque the woman look pretty except when you get near they but they be very clumsy about the waist they have all full white sleeve of some kind or other and most of they have big belt with a lot of strip of something flutter from they like the dress in a ballet but of course petticoat under they the strange figure we see be the slovaks who be more barbarian than the rest with their big cowboy hat great baggy dirty white trouser white linen shirt and enormous heavy leather belt nearly a foot wide all stud over with brass nail they wear high boot with their trouser tuck into they and have long black hair and heavy black moustache they be very picturesque but do not look prepossess on the stage they would be set down at once as some old oriental band of brigand they be however i be tell very harmless and rather want in natural self assertion it be on the dark side of twilight when we get to bistritz which be a very interesting old place be practically on the frontier for the borgo pass lead from it into bukovina it have have a very stormy existence and it certainly show mark of it fifty year ago a series of great fire take place which make terrible havoc on five separate occasion at the very beginning of the seventeenth century it undergo a siege of three week and lose people the casualty of war proper be assist by famine and disease count dracula have direct i to go to the golden krone hotel which i find to my delight to be thoroughly old fashion for of course i want to see all i could of the way of the country i be evidently expect for when i get near the door i face a cheery look elderly woman in the usual peasant dress white undergarment with long double apron front and back of coloured stuff fit almost too tight for modesty when i come close she bow and say the herr englishman yes i say jonathan harker she smile and give some message to an elderly man in white shirt sleeve who have follow she to the door he go but immediately return with a to the carpathians i be anxiously expect you sleep well to night at three to morrow the diligence will start for bukovina a place on it be keep for you at the borgo pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to i i trust that your journey from london have be a happy one and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land your friend find that my landlord have get a letter from the count direct he to secure the good place on the coach for i but on make inquiry as to detail he seem somewhat reticent and pretend that he could not understand my german this could not be true because up to then he have understand it perfectly at least he answer my question exactly as if he do he and his wife the old lady who have receive i look at each other in a frightened sort of way he mumble out that the money have be send in a letter and that be all he know when i ask he if he know count dracula and could tell i anything of his castle both he and his wife cross themselves and say that they know nothing at all simply refuse to speak far it be so near the time of start that i have no time to ask any one else for it be all very mysterious and not by any mean comfort just before i be leave the old lady come up to my room and say in a very hysterical way must you go oh young herr must you go she be in such an excited state that she seem to have lose her grip of what german she know and mix it all up with some other language which i do not know at all i be just able to follow she by ask many question when i tell she that i must go at once and that i be engage on important business she ask again do you know what day it be i answer that it be the fourth of may she shake her head as she say again oh yes i know that i know that but do you know what day it be on my saying that i do not understand she go on it be the eve of george day do you not know that to night when the clock strike midnight all the evil thing in the world will have full sway do you know where you be go and what you be go to she be in such evident distress that i try to comfort she but without effect finally she go down on her knee and implore i not to go at least to wait a day or two before start it be all very ridiculous but i do not feel comfortable however there be business to be do and i could allow nothing to interfere with it i therefore try to raise she up and say as gravely as i could that i thank she but my duty be imperative and that i must go she then rise and dry her eye and take a crucifix from her neck offer it to i i do not know what to do for as an english churchman i have be teach to regard such thing as in some measure idolatrous and yet it seem so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind she see i suppose the doubt in my face for she put the rosary round my neck and say for your mother sake and go out of the room i be write up this part of the diary whilst i be wait for the coach which be of course late and the crucifix be still round my neck whether it be the old lady fear or the many ghostly tradition of this place or the crucifix itself i do not know but i be not feel nearly as easy in my mind as usual if this book should ever reach mina before i do let it bring my good bye here come the coach may the grey of the morning have pass and the sun be high over the distant horizon which seem jagged whether with tree or hill i know not for it be so far off that big thing and little be mixed i be not sleepy and as i be not to be call till i awake naturally i write till sleep come there be many odd thing to put down and lest who read they may fancy that i din too well before i leave bistritz let i put down my dinner exactly i din on what they call robber of bacon onion and beef season with red pepper and string on stick and roast over the fire in the simple style of the london meat the wine be golden mediasch which produce a queer sting on the tongue which be however not disagreeable i have only a couple of glass of this and nothing else when i get on the coach the driver have not take his seat and i see he talk with the landlady they be evidently talk of i for every now and then they look at i and some of the people who be sit on the bench outside the door which they call by a name mean word and listen and then they look at i most of they pityingly i could hear a lot of word often repeat queer word for there be many nationality in the crowd so i quietly get my polyglot dictionary from my bag and look they out i must say they be not cheer to i for amongst they be vrolok and of which mean the same thing one be slovak and the other servian for something that be either be wolf or vampire mem i must ask the count about these superstition when we start the crowd round the inn door which have by this time swell to a considerable size all make the sign of the cross and point two finger towards i with some difficulty i get a fellow passenger to tell i what they mean he would not answer at first but on learn that i be english he explain that it be a charm or guard against the evil eye this be not very pleasant for i just start for an unknown place to meet an unknown man but every one seem so kind hearte and so sorrowful and so sympathetic that i could not but be touch i shall never forget the last glimpse which i have of the inn yard and its crowd of picturesque figure all cross themselves as they stand round the wide archway with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange tree in green tub cluster in the centre of the yard then our driver whose wide linen drawer cover the whole front of the box they call they crack his big whip over his four small horse which run abreast and we set off on our journey i soon lose sight and recollection of ghostly fear in the beauty of the scene as we drive along although have i know the language or rather language which my fellow passenger be speak i might not have be able to throw they off so easily before we lie a green slop land full of forest and wood with here and there steep hill crown with clump of tree or with farmhouse the blank gable end to the road there be everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom apple plum pear cherry and as we drive by i could see the green grass under the tree spangle with the fallen petal in and out amongst these green hill of what they call here the mittel land run the road lose itself as it sweep round the grassy curve or be shut out by the straggling end of pine wood which here and there run down the hillside like tongue of flame the road be rugge but still we seem to fly over it with a feverish haste i could not understand then what the haste mean but the driver be evidently bent on lose no time in reach borgo prund i be tell that this road be in summer time excellent but that it have not yet be put in order after the winter snow in this respect it be different from the general run of road in the carpathians for it be an old tradition that they be not to be keep in too good order of old the hospadars would not repair they lest the turk should think that they be prepare to bring in foreign troop and so hasten the war which be always really at loading point beyond the green swell hill of the mittel land rise mighty slope of forest up to the lofty steep of the carpathians themselves right and leave of we they tower with the afternoon sun fall upon they and bring out all the glorious colour of this beautiful range deep blue and purple in the shadow of the peak green and brown where grass and rock mingle and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crag till these be themselves lose in the distance where the snowy peak rise grandly here and there seem mighty rift in the mountain through which as the sun begin to sink we see now and again the white gleam of fall water one of my companion touch my arm as we sweep round the base of a hill and open up the lofty snow cover peak of a mountain which seem as we wound on our serpentine way to be right before look isten he cross himself reverently as we wound on our endless way and the sun sink lower and low behind we the shadow of the evening begin to creep round we this be emphasise by the fact that the snowy mountain top still hold the sunset and seem to glow out with a delicate cool pink here and there we pass cszeks and slovaks all in picturesque attire but i notice that goitre be painfully prevalent by the roadside be many cross and as we sweep by my companion all cross themselves here and there be a peasant man or woman kneel before a shrine who do not even turn round as we approach but seem in the self surrender of devotion to have neither eye nor ear for the outer world there be many thing new to i for instance hay rick in the tree and here and there very beautiful mass of weeping birch their white stem shin like silver through the delicate green of the leaf now and again we pass a leiterwagon the ordinary peasant cart with its long snake like vertebra calculate to suit the inequality of the road on this be sure to be seat quite a group of home come peasant the cszeks with their white and the slovaks with their colour sheepskin the latter carry lance fashion their long stave with axe at end as the evening fall it begin to get very cold and the grow twilight seem to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the tree oak beech and pine though in the valley which run deep between the spur of the hill as we ascend through the pass the dark fir stand out here and there against the background of late lie snow sometimes as the road be cut through the pine wood that seem in the darkness to be close down upon we great mass of greyness which here and there bestrew the tree produce a peculiarly weird and solemn effect which carry on the thought and grim fancy engender early in the evening when the fall sunset throw into strange relief the ghost like cloud which amongst the carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valley sometimes the hill be so steep that despite our driver haste the horse could only go slowly i wish to get down and walk up they as we do at home but the driver would not hear of it no no he say you must not walk here the dog be too fierce and then he add with what he evidently mean for grim pleasantry for he look round to catch the approve smile of the you may have enough of such matter before you go to sleep the only stop he would make be a moment pause to light his lamp when it grow dark there seem to be some excitement amongst the passenger and they keep speak to he one after the other as though urge he to further speed he lash the horse unmercifully with his long whip and with wild cry of encouragement urge they on to further exertion then through the darkness i could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of we as though there be a cleft in the hill the excitement of the passenger grow great the crazy coach rock on its great leather spring and sway like a boat toss on a stormy sea i have to hold on the road grow more level and we appear to fly along then the mountain seem to come near to we on each side and to frown down upon we we be enter the borgo pass one by one several of the passenger offer i gift which they press upon i with earnestness which would take no denial these be certainly of an odd and varied kind but each be give in simple good faith with a kindly word and a blessing and that strange mixture of fear mean movement which i have see outside the hotel at bistritz the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye then as we fly along the driver lean forward and on each side the passenger crane over the edge of the coach peer eagerly into the darkness it be evident that something very exciting be either happen or expect but though i ask each passenger no one would give i the slight explanation this state of excitement keep on for some little time and at last we see before we the pass opening out on the eastern side there be dark rolling cloud overhead and in the air the heavy oppressive sense of thunder it seem as though the mountain range have separate two atmosphere and that now we have get into the thunderous one i be now myself look out for the conveyance which be to take i to the count each moment i expect to see the glare of lamp through the blackness but all be dark the only light be the flicker ray of our own lamp in which steam from our hard drive horse rise in a white cloud we could now see the sandy road lie white before we but there be on it no sign of a vehicle the passenger draw back with a sigh of gladness which seem to mock my own disappointment i be already think what i have good do when the driver look at his watch say to the other something which i could hardly hear it be speak so quietly and in so low a tone i think it be an hour less than the time then turn to i he say in german bad than my there be no carriage here the herr be not expect after all he will now come on to bukovina and return to morrow or the next day well the next day whilst he be speak the horse begin to neigh and snort and plunge wildly so that the driver have to hold they up then amongst a chorus of scream from the peasant and a universal crossing of themselves a calèche with four horse drive up behind we overtake we and draw up beside the coach i could see from the flash of our lamp as the ray fall on they that the horse be coal black and splendid animal they be drive by a tall man with a long brown beard and a great black hat which seem to hide his face from we i could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eye which seem red in the lamplight as he turn to we he say to the you be early to night my friend the man stammer in the english herr be in a hurry to which the strange that be why i suppose you wish he to go on to bukovina you can not deceive i my friend i know too much and my horse be swift as he speak he smile and the lamplight fall on a hard look mouth with very red lip and sharp look tooth as white as ivory one of my companion whisper to another the line from burger denn die todten reiten schnell for the dead travel fast the strange driver evidently hear the word for he look up with a gleam smile the passenger turn his face away at the same time put out his two finger and cross himself give i the herr luggage say the driver and with exceed alacrity my bag be hand out and put in the calèche then i descend from the side of the coach as the calèche be close alongside the driver help i with a hand which catch my arm in a grip of steel his strength must have be prodigious without a word he shake his rein the horse turn and we sweep into the darkness of the pass as i look back i see the steam from the horse of the coach by the light of the lamp and project against it the figure of my late companion cross themselves then the driver crack his whip and call to his horse and off they sweep on their way to bukovina as they sink into the darkness i feel a strange chill and a lonely feeling come over i but a cloak be throw over my shoulder and a rug across my knee and the driver say in excellent the night be chill mein herr and my master the count bid i take all care of you there be a flask of slivovitz the plum brandy of the country underneath the seat if you should require it i do not take any but it be a comfort to know it be there all the same i feel a little strange and not a little frightened i think have there be any alternative i should have take it instead of prosecute that unknown night journey the carriage go at a hard pace straight along then we make a complete turn and go along another straight road it seem to i that we be simply go over and over the same ground again and so i take note of some salient point and find that this be so i would have like to have ask the driver what this all mean but i really fear to do so for i think that place as i be any protest would have have no effect in case there have be an intention to delay by and by however as i be curious to know how time be pass i strike a match and by its flame look at my watch it be within a few minute of midnight this give i a sort of shock for i suppose the general superstition about midnight be increase by my recent experience i wait with a sick feeling of suspense then a dog begin to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road a long agonise wailing as if from fear the sound be take up by another dog and then another and another till bear on the wind which now sigh softly through the pass a wild howling begin which seem to come from all over the country as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night at the first howl the horse begin to strain and rear but the driver speak to they soothingly and they quiet down but shiver and sweat as though after a runaway from sudden fright then far off in the distance from the mountain on each side of we begin a loud and sharp howling that of wolf which affect both the horse and myself in the same way for i be minded to jump from the calèche and run whilst they rear again and plunge madly so that the driver have to use all his great strength to keep they from bolt in a few minute however my own ear get accustom to the sound and the horse so far become quiet that the driver be able to descend and to stand before they he pet and soothe they and whisper something in their ear as i have hear of horse tamer doing and with extraordinary effect for under his caress they become quite manageable again though they still tremble the driver again take his seat and shake his rein start off at a great pace this time after go to the far side of the pass he suddenly turn down a narrow roadway which run sharply to the right soon we be hem in with tree which in place arch right over the roadway till we pass as through a tunnel and again great frown rock guard we boldly on either side though we be in shelter we could hear the rise wind for it moan and whistle through the rock and the branch of the tree crash together as we sweep along it grow cold and cold still and fine powdery snow begin to fall so that soon we and all around we be cover with a white blanket the keen wind still carry the howling of the dog though this grow fainter as we go on our way the baying of the wolf sound near and nearer as though they be close round on we from every side i grow dreadfully afraid and the horse share my fear but the driver be not in the least disturbed he keep turn his head to leave and right but i could not see anything through the darkness suddenly away on our left i see a faint flicker blue flame the driver see it at the same moment he at once check the horse and jump to the ground disappear into the darkness i do not know what to do the less as the howling of the wolf grow close but while i wonder the driver suddenly appear again and without a word take his seat and we resume our journey i think i must have fall asleep and keep dream of the incident for it seem to be repeat endlessly and now look back it be like a sort of awful nightmare once the flame appear so near the road that even in the darkness around we i could watch the driver motion he go rapidly to where the blue flame rise it must have be very faint for it do not seem to illumine the place around it at all and gather a few stone form they into some device once there appear a strange optical effect when he stand between i and the flame he do not obstruct it for i could see its ghostly flicker all the same this startle i but as the effect be only momentary i take it that my eye deceive i strain through the darkness then for a time there be no blue flame and we speed onwards through the gloom with the howling of the wolf around we as though they be follow in a move circle at last there come a time when the driver go far afield than he have yet do and during his absence the horse begin to tremble bad than ever and to snort and scream with fright i could not see any cause for it for the howling of the wolf have cease altogether but just then the moon sail through the black cloud appear behind the jagged crest of a beetle pine clothe rock and by its light i see around we a ring of wolf with white tooth and loll red tongue with long sinewy limb and shaggy hair they be a hundred time more terrible in the grim silence which hold they than even when they howl for myself i feel a sort of paralysis of fear it be only when a man feel himself face to face with such horror that he can understand their true import all at once the wolf begin to howl as though the moonlight have have some peculiar effect on they the horse jump about and rear and look helplessly round with eye that roll in a way painful to see but the living ring of terror encompass they on every side and they have perforce to remain within it i call to the coachman to come for it seem to i that our only chance be to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach i shout and beat the side of the calèche hop by the noise to scare the wolf from that side so as to give he a chance of reach the trap how he come there i know not but i hear his voice raise in a tone of imperious command and look towards the sound see he stand in the roadway as he sweep his long arm as though brush aside some impalpable obstacle the wolf fall back and back far still just then a heavy cloud pass across the face of the moon so that we be again in darkness when i could see again the driver be climb into the calèche and the wolf have disappear this be all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear come upon i and i be afraid to speak or move the time seem interminable as we sweep on our way now in almost complete darkness for the rolling cloud obscure the moon we keep on ascend with occasional period of quick descent but in the main always ascend suddenly i become conscious of the fact that the driver be in the act of pull up the horse in the courtyard of a vast ruin castle from whose tall black window come no ray of light and whose broken battlement show a jagged line against the moonlit sky,5688
2,CHAPTER 02,chapter ii harker must have be asleep for certainly if i have be fully awake i must have notice the approach to such a remarkable place in the gloom the courtyard look of considerable size and as several dark way lead from it under great round arch it perhaps seem big than it really be i have not yet be able to see it by daylight when the calèche stop the driver jump down and hold out his hand to assist i to alight again i could not but notice his prodigious strength his hand actually seem like a steel vice that could have crush mine if he have choose then he take out my trap and place they on the ground beside i as i stand close to a great door old and stud with large iron nail and set in a project doorway of massive stone i could see even in the dim light that the stone be massively carve but that the carving have be much wear by time and weather as i stand the driver jump again into his seat and shake the rein the horse start forward and trap and all disappear down one of the dark opening i stand in silence where i be for i do not know what to do of bell or knocker there be no sign through these frown wall and dark window opening it be not likely that my voice could penetrate the time i wait seem endless and i feel doubt and fear crowd upon i what sort of place have i come to and among what kind of people what sort of grim adventure be it on which i have embark be this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor clerk send out to explain the purchase of a london estate to a foreigner solicitor clerk mina would not like that just before leave london i get word that my examination be successful and i be now a full blown solicitor i begin to rub my eye and pinch myself to see if i be awake it all seem like a horrible nightmare to i and i expect that i should suddenly awake and find myself at home with the dawn struggle in through the window as i have now and again feel in the morning after a day of overwork but my flesh answer the pinching test and my eye be not to be deceive i be indeed awake and among the carpathians all i could do now be to be patient and to wait the coming of the morning just as i have come to this conclusion i hear a heavy step approach behind the great door and see through the chink the gleam of a come light then there be the sound of rattle chain and the clanking of massive bolt draw back a key be turn with the loud grating noise of long disuse and the great door swing back within stand a tall old man clean shaven save for a long white moustache and clothe in black from head to foot without a single speck of colour about he anywhere he hold in his hand an antique silver lamp in which the flame burn without chimney or globe of any kind throw long quiver shadow as it flicker in the draught of the open door the old man motion i in with his right hand with a courtly gesture say in excellent english but with a strange welcome to my house enter freely and of your own will he make no motion of step to meet i but stand like a statue as though his gesture of welcome have fix he into stone the instant however that i have step over the threshold he move impulsively forward and hold out his hand grasp mine with a strength which make i wince an effect which be not lessen by the fact that it seem as cold as ice more like the hand of a dead than a live man again he welcome to my house come freely go safely and leave something of the happiness you bring the strength of the handshake be so much akin to that which i have notice in the driver whose face i have not see that for a moment i doubt if it be not the same person to whom i be speak so to make sure i say count dracula he bow in a courtly way as he i be dracula and i bid you welcome harker to my house come in the night air be chill and you must need to eat and rest as he be speak he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall and step out take my luggage he have carry it in before i could forestall he i protest but he nay sir you be my guest it be late and my people be not available let i see to your comfort myself he insist on carry my trap along the passage and then up a great wind stair and along another great passage on whose stone floor our step ring heavily at the end of this he throw open a heavy door and i rejoice to see within a well light room in which a table be spread for supper and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of log flame and flare the count halt put down my bag close the door and cross the room open another door which lead into a small octagonal room light by a single lamp and seemingly without a window of any sort pass through this he open another door and motion i to enter it be a welcome sight for here be a great bedroom well light and warm with another log fire which send a hollow roar up the wide chimney the count himself leave my luggage inside and withdraw say before he close the you will need after your journey to refresh yourself by make your toilet i trust you will find all you wish when you be ready come into the other room where you will find your supper prepare the light and warmth and the count courteous welcome seem to have dissipate all my doubt and fear have then reach my normal state i discover that i be half famish with hunger so make a hasty toilet i go into the other room i find supper already lay out my host who stand on one side of the great fireplace lean against the stonework make a graceful wave of his hand to the table and i pray you be seat and sup how you please you will i trust excuse i that i do not join you but i have din already and i do not sup i hand to he the sealed letter which hawkins have entrust to i he open it and read it gravely then with a charming smile he hand it to i to read one passage of it at least give i a thrill of i much regret that an attack of gout from which malady i be a constant sufferer forbid absolutely any travel on my part for some time to come but i be happy to say i can send a sufficient substitute one in whom i have every possible confidence he be a young man full of energy and talent in his own way and of a very faithful disposition he be discreet and silent and have grow into manhood in my service he shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay and shall take your instruction in all matter the count himself come forward and take off the cover of a dish and i fall to at once on an excellent roast chicken this with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old tokay of which i have two glass be my supper during the time i be eat it the count ask i many question as to my journey and i tell he by degree all i have experience by this time i have finish my supper and by my host desire have draw up a chair by the fire and begin to smoke a cigar which he offer i at the same time excuse himself that he do not smoke i have now an opportunity of observe he and find he of a very marked physiognomy his face be a strong a very strong aquiline with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arch nostril with lofty domed forehead and hair grow scantily round the temple but profusely elsewhere his eyebrow be very massive almost meet over the nose and with bushy hair that seem to curl in its own profusion the mouth so far as i could see it under the heavy moustache be fix and rather cruel looking with peculiarly sharp white tooth these protrude over the lip whose remarkable ruddiness show astonishing vitality in a man of his year for the rest his ear be pale and at the top extremely point the chin be broad and strong and the cheek firm though thin the general effect be one of extraordinary pallor hitherto i have notice the back of his hand as they lie on his knee in the firelight and they have seem rather white and fine but see they now close to i i could not but notice that they be rather coarse broad with squat finger strange to say there be hair in the centre of the palm the nail be long and fine and cut to a sharp point as the count lean over i and his hand touch i i could not repress a shudder it may have be that his breath be rank but a horrible feeling of nausea come over i which do what i would i could not conceal the count evidently notice it draw back and with a grim sort of smile which show more than he have yet do his protuberant tooth sit himself down again on his own side of the fireplace we be both silent for a while and as i look towards the window i see the first dim streak of the come dawn there seem a strange stillness over everything but as i listen i hear as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolf the count eye gleam and he listen to they the child of the night what music they make see i suppose some expression in my face strange to he he ah sir you dweller in the city can not enter into the feeling of the hunter then he rise and but you must be tired your bedroom be all ready and to morrow you shall sleep as late as you will i have to be away till the afternoon so sleep well and dream well and with a courteous bow he open for i himself the door to the octagonal room and i enter my bedroom i be all in a sea of wonder i doubt i fear i think strange thing which i dare not confess to my own soul god keep i if only for the sake of those dear to i be again early morning but i have rest and enjoy the last twenty four hour i sleep till late in the day and awake of my own accord when i have dress myself i go into the room where we have sup and find a cold breakfast lay out with coffee keep hot by the pot be place on the hearth there be a card on the table on which be i have to be absent for a while do not wait for so i set to and enjoy a hearty meal when i have do i look for a bell so that i might let the servant know i have finish but i could not find one there be certainly odd deficiency in the house consider the extraordinary evidence of wealth which be round i the table service be of gold and so beautifully work that it must be of immense value the curtain and upholstery of the chair and sofa and the hanging of my bed be of the costly and most beautiful fabric and must have be of fabulous value when they be make for they be century old though in excellent order i see something like they in hampton court but there they be wear and fray and moth eat but still in none of the room be there a mirror there be not even a toilet glass on my table and i have to get the little shaving glass from my bag before i could either shave or brush my hair i have not yet see a servant anywhere or hear a sound near the castle except for the howling of wolf when i have finish my meal i do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner for it be between five and six when i have it i look about for something to read for i do not like to go about the castle until i have ask the count permission there be absolutely nothing in the room book newspaper or even write material so i open another door in the room and find a sort of library the door opposite mine i try but find it lock in the library i find to my great delight a vast number of english book whole shelf full of they and bind volume of magazine and newspaper a table in the centre be litter with english magazine and newspaper though none of they be of very recent date the book be of the most varied kind history geography politic political economy botany geology law all relate to england and english life and custom and manner there be even such book of reference as the london directory the red and blue book whitaker almanack the army and navy lists and it somehow gladden my heart to see it the law list whilst i be look at the book the door open and the count enter he salute i in a hearty way and hop that i have have a good night rest then he go i be glad you find your way in here for i be sure there be much that will interest you these he lay his hand on some of the be good friend to i and for some year past ever since i have the idea of go to london have give i many many hour of pleasure through they i have come to know your great england and to know she be to love she i long to go through the crowded street of your mighty london to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity to share its life its change its death and all that make it what it be but alas as yet i only know your tongue through book to you my friend i look that i know it to speak but count i say you know and speak english thoroughly he bow gravely i thank you my friend for your all too flattering estimate but yet i fear that i be but a little way on the road i would travel true i know the grammar and the word but yet i know not how to speak they indeed i say you speak excellently not so he answer well i know that do i move and speak in your london none there be who would not know i for a stranger that be not enough for i here i be noble i be boyar the common people know i and i be master but a stranger in a strange land he be no one man know he not and to know not be to care not for i be content if i be like the rest so that no man stop if he see i or pause in his speaking if he hear my word to say ha ha a stranger i have be so long master that i would be master still or at least that none other should be master of i you come to i not alone as agent of my friend peter hawkins of exeter to tell i all about my new estate in london you shall i trust rest here with i a while so that by our talk i may learn the english intonation and i would that you tell i when i make error even of the small in my speaking i be sorry that i have to be away so long to day but you will i know forgive one who have so many important affair in hand of course i say all i could about be willing and ask if i might come into that room when i choose he answer yes certainly and you may go anywhere you wish in the castle except where the door be lock where of course you will not wish to go there be reason that all thing be as they be and do you see with my eye and know with my knowledge you would perhaps well understand i say i be sure of this and then he go we be in transylvania and transylvania be not england our way be not your way and there shall be to you many strange thing nay from what you have tell i of your experience already you know something of what strange thing here may be this lead to much conversation and as it be evident that he want to talk if only for talk sake i ask he many question regard thing that have already happen to i or come within my notice sometimes he sheer off the subject or turn the conversation by pretend not to understand but generally he answer all i ask most frankly then as time go on and i have get somewhat bolder i ask he of some of the strange thing of the precede night as for instance why the coachman go to the place where we have see the blue flame be it indeed true that they show where gold be hide he then explain to i that it be commonly believe that on a certain night of the year last night in fact when all evil spirit be suppose to have unchecked sway a blue flame be see over any place where treasure have be conceal that treasure have be hide he go on in the region through which you come last night there can be but little doubt for it be the ground fight over for century by the wallachian the saxon and the turk why there be hardly a foot of soil in all this region that have not be enrich by the blood of man patriot or invader in old day there be stir time when the austrian and the hungarian come up in horde and the patriot go out to meet they man and woman the aged and the child too and wait their come on the rock above the pass that they might sweep destruction on they with their artificial avalanche when the invader be triumphant he find but little for whatever there be have be shelter in the friendly soil but how say i can it have remain so long undiscovered when there be a sure index to it if man will but take the trouble to look the count smile and as his lip run back over his gum the long sharp canine tooth show out strangely he because your peasant be at heart a coward and a fool those flame only appear on one night and on that night no man of this land will if he can help it stir without his door and dear sir even if he do he would not know what to do why even the peasant that you tell i of who mark the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work you would not i dare be swear be able to find these place again there you be right i say i know no more than the dead where even to look for they then we drift into other matter come he say at last tell i of london and of the house which you have procure for i with an apology for my remissness i go into my own room to get the paper from my bag whilst i be place they in order i hear a rattling of china and silver in the next room and as i pass through notice that the table have be clear and the lamp light for it be by this time deep into the dark the lamp be also light in the study or library and i find the count lie on the sofa reading of all thing in the world an english bradshaw guide when i come in he clear the book and paper from the table and with he i go into plan and deed and figure of all sort he be interested in everything and ask i a myriad question about the place and its surrounding he clearly have study beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood for he evidently at the end know very much more than i do when i remark this he well but my friend be it not needful that i should when i go there i shall be all alone and my friend harker jonathan nay pardon i i fall into my country habit of put your patronymic first my friend jonathan harker will not be by my side to correct and aid i he will be in exeter mile away probably work at paper of the law with my other friend peter hawkins so we go thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at purfleet when i have tell he the fact and get his signature to the necessary paper and have write a letter with they ready to post to hawkins he begin to ask i how i have come across so suitable a place i read to he the note which i have make at the time and which i inscribe at purfleet on a by road i come across just such a place as seem to be require and where be display a dilapidated notice that the place be for sale it be surround by a high wall of ancient structure build of heavy stone and have not be repair for a large number of year the closed gate be of heavy old oak and iron all eat with rust the estate be call carfax no doubt a corruption of the old quatre face as the house be four sided agree with the cardinal point of the compass it contain in all some twenty acre quite surround by the solid stone wall above mention there be many tree on it which make it in place gloomy and there be a deep dark look pond or small lake evidently feed by some spring as the water be clear and flow away in a fair sized stream the house be very large and of all period back i should say to mediæval time for one part be of stone immensely thick with only a few window high up and heavily bar with iron it look like part of a keep and be close to an old chapel or church i could not enter it as i have not the key of the door lead to it from the house but i have take with my kodak view of it from various point the house have be add to but in a very straggling way and i can only guess at the amount of ground it cover which must be very great there be but few house close at hand one be a very large house only recently add to and form into a private lunatic asylum it be not however visible from the ground when i have finish he i be glad that it be old and big i myself be of an old family and to live in a new house would kill i a house can not be make habitable in a day and after all how few day go to make up a century i rejoice that there be a chapel of old time we transylvanian noble love not to think that our bone may be amongst the common dead i seek not gaiety nor mirth not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkle water which please the young and gay i be no long young and my heart through weary year of mourn over the dead be not attuned to mirth moreover the wall of my castle be break the shadow be many and the wind breathe cold through the broken battlement and casement i love the shade and the shadow and would be alone with my thought when i may somehow his word and his look do not seem to accord or else it be that his cast of face make his smile look malignant and saturnine presently with an excuse he leave i ask i to put all my paper together he be some little time away and i begin to look at some of the book around i one be an atlas which i find open naturally at england as if that map have be much use on look at it i find in certain place little ring mark and on examine these i notice that one be near london on the east side manifestly where his new estate be situate the other two be exeter and whitby on the yorkshire coast it be the well part of an hour when the count return aha he say still at your book good but you must not work always come i be inform that your supper be ready he take my arm and we go into the next room where i find an excellent supper ready on the table the count again excuse himself as he have din out on his be away from home but he sit as on the previous night and chat whilst i eat after supper i smoke as on the last evening and the count stay with i chat and ask question on every conceivable subject hour after hour i feel that it be get very late indeed but i do not say anything for i feel under obligation to meet my host wish in every way i be not sleepy as the long sleep yesterday have fortify i but i could not help experience that chill which come over one at the coming of dawn which be like in its way the turn of the tide they say that people who be near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide any one who have when tired and tie as it be to his post experience this change in the atmosphere can well believe it all at once we hear the crow of a cock come up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air count dracula jump to his foot why there be the morning again how remiss i be to let you stay up so long you must make your conversation regard my dear new country of england less interesting so that i may not forget how time fly by we and with a courtly bow he leave i i go into my own room and draw the curtain but there be little to notice my window open into the courtyard all i could see be the warm grey quicken sky so i pull the curtain again and have write of this day begin to fear as i write in this book that i be get too diffuse but now i be glad that i go into detail from the first for there be something so strange about this place and all in it that i can not but feel uneasy i wish i be safe out of it or that i have never come it may be that this strange night existence be tell on i but would that that be all if there be any one to talk to i could bear it but there be no one i have only the count to speak with and fear i be myself the only live soul within the place let i be prosaic so far as fact can be it will help i to bear up and imagination must not run riot with i if it do i am lose let i say at once how i stand or seem to i only sleep a few hour when i go to bed and feel that i could not sleep any more get up i have hang my shaving glass by the window and be just begin to shave suddenly i feel a hand on my shoulder and hear the count voice say to i good morning i start for it amaze i that i have not see he since the reflection of the glass cover the whole room behind i in start i have cut myself slightly but do not notice it at the moment have answer the count salutation i turn to the glass again to see how i have be mistake this time there could be no error for the man be close to i and i could see he over my shoulder but there be no reflection of he in the mirror the whole room behind i be display but there be no sign of a man in it except myself this be startling and come on the top of so many strange thing be begin to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which i always have when the count be near but at that instant i see that the cut have bleed a little and the blood be trickle over my chin i lay down the razor turn as i do so half round to look for some stick plaster when the count see my face his eye blaze with a sort of demoniac fury and he suddenly make a grab at my throat i draw away and his hand touch the string of bead which hold the crucifix it make an instant change in he for the fury pass so quickly that i could hardly believe that it be ever there take care he say take care how you cut yourself it be more dangerous than you think in this country then seize the shaving glass he go on and this be the wretched thing that have do the mischief it be a foul bauble of man vanity away with it and open the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand he fling out the glass which be shatter into a thousand piece on the stone of the courtyard far below then he withdraw without a word it be very annoying for i do not see how i be to shave unless in my watch case or the bottom of the shaving pot which be fortunately of metal when i go into the dining room breakfast be prepare but i could not find the count anywhere so i breakfast alone it be strange that as yet i have not see the count eat or drink he must be a very peculiar man after breakfast i do a little explore in the castle i go out on the stair and find a room look towards the south the view be magnificent and from where i stand there be every opportunity of see it the castle be on the very edge of a terrible precipice a stone fall from the window would fall a thousand foot without touch anything as far as the eye can reach be a sea of green tree top with occasionally a deep rift where there be a chasm here and there be silver thread where the river wind in deep gorge through the forest but i be not in heart to describe beauty for when i have see the view i explore far door door door everywhere and all lock and bolt in no place save from the window in the castle wall be there an available exit the castle be a veritable prison and i be a prisoner,5475
3,CHAPTER 03,chapter iii harker continue when i find that i be a prisoner a sort of wild feeling come over i i rush up and down the stair try every door and peer out of every window i could find but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpower all other thing when i look back after a few hour i think i must have be mad for the time for i behave much as a rat do in a trap when however the conviction have come to i that i be helpless i sit down quietly as quietly as i have ever do anything in my life and begin to think over what be good to be do i be think still and as yet have come to no definite conclusion of one thing only be i certain that it be no use make my idea know to the count he know well that i be imprison and as he have do it himself and have doubtless his own motif for it he would only deceive i if i trust he fully with the fact so far as i can see my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fear to myself and my eye open i be i know either be deceive like a baby by my own fear or else i be in desperate strait and if the latter be so i need and shall need all my brain to get through i have hardly come to this conclusion when i hear the great door below shut and know that the count have return he do not come at once into the library so i go cautiously to my own room and find he make the bed this be odd but only confirm what i have all along thought that there be no servant in the house when later i see he through the chink of the hinge of the door lay the table in the dining room i be assure of it for if he do himself all these menial office surely it be proof that there be no one else to do they this give i a fright for if there be no one else in the castle it must have be the count himself who be the driver of the coach that bring i here this be a terrible thought for if so what do it mean that he could control the wolf as he do by only hold up his hand in silence how be it that all the people at bistritz and on the coach have some terrible fear for i what mean the giving of the crucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash bless that good good woman who hang the crucifix round my neck for it be a comfort and a strength to i whenever i touch it it be odd that a thing which i have be teach to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help be it that there be something in the essence of the thing itself or that it be a medium a tangible help in conveying memory of sympathy and comfort some time if it may be i must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it in the meantime i must find out all i can about count dracula as it may help i to understand to night he may talk of himself if i turn the conversation that way i must be very careful however not to awake his suspicion have have a long talk with the count i ask he a few question on transylvanian history and he warm up to the subject wonderfully in his speaking of thing and people and especially of battle he speak as if he have be present at they all this he afterwards explain by say that to a boyar the pride of his house and name be his own pride that their glory be his glory that their fate be his fate whenever he speak of his house he always say we and speak almost in the plural like a king speak i wish i could put down all he say exactly as he say it for to i it be most fascinating it seem to have in it a whole history of the country he grow excited as he speak and walk about the room pull his great white moustache and grasp anything on which he lay his hand as though he would crush it by main strength one thing he say which i shall put down as nearly as i can for it tell in its way the story of his we szekelys have a right to be proud for in our vein flow the blood of many brave race who fight as the lion fight for lordship here in the whirlpool of european race the ugric tribe bear down from iceland the fight spirit which thor and wodin give they which their berserker display to such fell intent on the seaboard of europe ay and of asia and africa too till the people think that the be wolf themselves have come here too when they come they find the huns whose warlike fury have sweep the earth like a live flame till the die people hold that in their vein run the blood of those old witch who expel from scythia have mat with the devil in the desert fools fool what devil or what witch be ever so great as attila whose blood be in these vein he hold up his arm be it a wonder that we be a conquering race that we be proud that when the magyar the lombard the avar the bulgar or the turk pour his thousand on our frontier we drive they back be it strange that when arpad and his legion sweep through the hungarian fatherland he find we here when he reach the frontier that the honfoglalas be complete there and when the hungarian flood sweep eastward the szekelys be claim as kindre by the victorious magyars and to we for century be trust the guarding of the frontier of turkey land ay and more than that endless duty of the frontier guard for as the turks say water sleep and enemy be sleepless who more gladly than we throughout the four nations receive the bloody sword or at its warlike call flock quick to the standard of the king when be redeem that great shame of my nation the shame of cassova when the flag of the wallach and the magyar go down beneath the crescent who be it but one of my own race who as voivode cross the danube and beat the turk on his own ground this be a dracula indeed woe be it that his own unworthy brother when he have fall sell his people to the turk and bring the shame of slavery on they be it not this dracula indeed who inspire that other of his race who in a later age again and again bring his force over the great river into turkey land who when he be beat back come again and again and again though he have to come alone from the bloody field where his troop be be slaughter since he know that he alone could ultimately triumph they say that he think only of himself bah what good be peasant without a leader where end the war without a brain and heart to conduct it again when after the battle of mohacs we throw off the hungarian yoke we of the dracula blood be amongst their leader for our spirit would not brook that we be not free ah young sir the szekelys and the dracula as their heart blood their brain and their sword can boast a record that mushroom growth like the hapsburgs and the romanoffs can never reach the warlike day be over blood be too precious a thing in these day of dishonourable peace and the glory of the great race be as a tale that be tell it be by this time close on morning and we go to bed mem this diary seem horribly like the beginning of the arabian nights for everything have to break off at cock crow or like the ghost of hamlet father i begin with fact bare meagre fact verify by book and figure and of which there can be no doubt i must not confuse they with experience which will have to rest on my own observation or my memory of they last evening when the count come from his room he begin by ask i question on legal matter and on the doing of certain kind of business i have spend the day wearily over book and simply to keep my mind occupy go over some of the matter i have be examine in at lincoln inn there be a certain method in the count inquire so i shall try to put they down in sequence the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to i first he ask if a man in england might have two solicitor or more i tell he he might have a dozen if he wish but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engage in one transaction as only one could act at a time and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest he seem thoroughly to understand and go on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in have one man to attend say to banking and another to look after shipping in case local help be need in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor i ask he to explain more fully so that i might not by any chance mislead he so he i shall illustrate your friend and mine peter hawkins from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at exeter which be far from london buy for i through your good self my place at london good now here let i say frankly lest you should think it strange that i have seek the service of one so far off from london instead of some one resident there that my motive be that no local interest might be serve save my wish only and as one of london resident might perhaps have some purpose of himself or friend to serve i go thus afield to seek my agent whose labour should be only to my interest now suppose i who have much of affair wish to ship good say to newcastle or durham or harwich or dover might it not be that it could with more ease be do by consign to one in these port i answer that certainly it would be most easy but that we solicitor have a system of agency one for the other so that local work could be do locally on instruction from any solicitor so that the client simply place himself in the hand of one man could have his wish carry out by he without further trouble but say he i could be at liberty to direct myself be it not so of course i reply and such be often do by man of business who do not like the whole of their affair to be know by any one person good he say and then go on to ask about the mean of make consignment and the form to be go through and of all sort of difficulty which might arise but by forethought could be guard against i explain all these thing to he to the good of my ability and he certainly leave i under the impression that he would have make a wonderful solicitor for there be nothing that he do not think of or foresee for a man who be never in the country and who do not evidently do much in the way of business his knowledge and acuman be wonderful when he have satisfy himself on these point of which he have speak and i have verify all as well as i could by the book available he suddenly stand up and have you write since your first letter to our friend peter hawkins or to any other it be with some bitterness in my heart that i answer that i have not that as yet i have not see any opportunity of send letter to anybody then write now my young friend he say lay a heavy hand on my shoulder write to our friend and to any other and say if it will please you that you shall stay with i until a month from now do you wish i to stay so long i ask for my heart grow cold at the thought i desire it much nay i will take no refusal when your master employer what you will engage that some one should come on his behalf it be understand that my need only be to be consult i have not stint be it not so what could i do but bow acceptance it be hawkins interest not mine and i have to think of he not myself and besides while count dracula be speak there be that in his eye and in his bearing which make i remember that i be a prisoner and that if i wish it i could have no choice the count see his victory in my bow and his mastery in the trouble of my face for he begin at once to use they but in his own smooth resistless i pray you my good young friend that you will not discourse of thing other than business in your letter it will doubtless please your friend to know that you be well and that you look forward to get home to they be it not so as he speak he hand i three sheet of notepaper and three envelope they be all of the thin foreign post and look at they then at he and notice his quiet smile with the sharp canine tooth lie over the red under lip i understand as well as if he have speak that i should be careful what i write for he would be able to read it so i determine to write only formal note now but to write fully to hawkins in secret and also to mina for to she i could write in shorthand which would puzzle the count if he do see it when i have write my two letter i sit quiet read a book whilst the count write several note refer as he write they to some book on his table then he take up my two and place they with his own and put by his writing material after which the instant the door have close behind he i lean over and look at the letter which be face down on the table i feel no compunction in do so for under the circumstance i feel that i should protect myself in every way i could one of the letter be direct to samuel billington no the crescent whitby another to herr leutner varna the third be to coutts london and the fourth to herren klopstock billreuth banker buda pesth the second and fourth be unseal i be just about to look at they when i see the door handle move i sink back in my seat have just have time to replace the letter as they have be and to resume my book before the count hold still another letter in his hand enter the room he take up the letter on the table and stamp they carefully and then turn to i i trust you will forgive i but i have much work to do in private this evening you will i hope find all thing as you wish at the door he turn and after a moment pause let i advise you my dear young friend nay let i warn you with all seriousness that should you leave these room you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle it be old and have many memory and there be bad dream for those who sleep unwisely be warn should sleep now or ever overcome you or be like to do then haste to your own chamber or to these room for your rest will then be safe but if you be not careful in this respect finish his speech in a gruesome way for he motion with his hand as if he be wash they i quite understand my only doubt be as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural horrible net of gloom and mystery which seem close round i endorse the last word write but this time there be no doubt in question i shall not fear to sleep in any place where he be not i have place the crucifix over the head of my bed i imagine that my rest be thus free from dream and there it shall remain when he leave i i go to my room after a little while not hear any sound i come out and go up the stone stair to where i could look out towards the south there be some sense of freedom in the vast expanse inaccessible though it be to i as compare with the narrow darkness of the courtyard look out on this i feel that i be indeed in prison and i seem to want a breath of fresh air though it be of the night i be begin to feel this nocturnal existence tell on i it be destroy my nerve i start at my own shadow and be full of all sort of horrible imagining god know that there be ground for any terrible fear in this accursed place i look out over the beautiful expanse bath in soft yellow moonlight till it be almost as light as day in the soft light the distant hill become melt and the shadow in the valley and gorge of velvety blackness the mere beauty seem to cheer i there be peace and comfort in every breath i draw as i lean from the window my eye be catch by something move a storey below i and somewhat to my left where i imagine from the lie of the room that the window of the count own room would look out the window at which i stand be tall and deep stone mullione and though weather wear be still complete but it be evidently many a day since the case have be there i draw back behind the stonework and look carefully out what i see be the count head come out from the window i do not see the face but i know the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arm in any case i could not mistake the hand which i have have so many opportunity of study i be at first interested and somewhat amused for it be wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he be a prisoner but my very feeling change to repulsion and terror when i see the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss face down with his cloak spread out around he like great wing at first i could not believe my eye i think it be some trick of the moonlight some weird effect of shadow but i keep look and it could be no delusion i see the finger and toe grasp the corner of the stone wear clear of the mortar by the stress of year and by thus use every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed just as a lizard move along a wall what manner of man be this or what manner of creature be it in the semblance of man i feel the dread of this horrible place overpower i i be in fear in awful fear and there be no escape for i i be encompass about with terror that i dare not think of more have i see the count go out in his lizard fashion he move downwards in a sidelong way some hundred foot down and a good deal to the left he vanish into some hole or window when his head have disappear i lean out to try and see more but without avail the distance be too great to allow a proper angle of sight i know he have leave the castle now and think to use the opportunity to explore more than i have dare to do as yet i go back to the room and take a lamp try all the door they be all lock as i have expect and the lock be comparatively new but i go down the stone stair to the hall where i have enter originally i find i could pull back the bolt easily enough and unhook the great chain but the door be lock and the key be go that key must be in the count room i must watch should his door be unlocked so that i may get it and escape i go on to make a thorough examination of the various stair and passage and to try the door that open from they one or two small room near the hall be open but there be nothing to see in they except old furniture dusty with age and moth eat at last however i find one door at the top of a stairway which though it seem to be lock give a little under pressure i try it hard and find that it be not really lock but that the resistance come from the fact that the hinge have fall somewhat and the heavy door rest on the floor here be an opportunity which i might not have again so i exert myself and with many effort force it back so that i could enter i be now in a wing of the castle far to the right than the room i know and a story low down from the window i could see that the suite of room lie along to the south of the castle the window of the end room look out both west and south on the latter side as well as to the former there be a great precipice the castle be build on the corner of a great rock so that on three side it be quite impregnable and great window be place here where sling or bow or culverin could not reach and consequently light and comfort impossible to a position which have to be guard be secure to the west be a great valley and then rise far away great jagged mountain fastness rise peak on peak the sheer rock stud with mountain ash and thorn whose root clung in crack and crevice and cranny of the stone this be evidently the portion of the castle occupy in bygone day for the furniture have more air of comfort than any i have see the window be curtainless and the yellow moonlight flood in through the diamond pane enable one to see even colour whilst it soften the wealth of dust which lie over all and disguise in some measure the ravage of time and the moth my lamp seem to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight but i be glad to have it with i for there be a dread loneliness in the place which chill my heart and make my nerve tremble still it be well than live alone in the room which i have come to hate from the presence of the count and after try a little to school my nerve i find a soft quietude come over i here i be sit at a little oak table where in old time possibly some fair lady sit to pen with much thought and many blush her ill spelt love letter and write in my diary in shorthand all that have happen since i close it last it be nineteenth century up to date with a vengeance and yet unless my sens deceive i the old century have and have power of their own which mere modernity can not kill later the morning of preserve my sanity for to this i be reduce safety and the assurance of safety be thing of the past whilst i live on here there be but one thing to hope for that i may not go mad if indeed i be not mad already if i be sane then surely it be madden to think that of all the foul thing that lurk in this hateful place the count be the least dreadful to i that to he alone i can look for safety even though this be only whilst i can serve his purpose great god merciful god let i be calm for out of that way lie madness indeed i begin to get new light on certain thing which have puzzle i up to now i never quite know what shakespeare mean when he make hamlet my tablet quick my tablet tis meet that i put it down etc for now feel as though my own brain be unhinge or as if the shock have come which must end in its undoing i turn to my diary for repose the habit of enter accurately must help to soothe i the count mysterious warning frighten i at the time it frighten i more now when i think of it for in future he have a fearful hold upon i i shall fear to doubt what he may say when i have write in my diary and have fortunately replace the book and pen in my pocket i feel sleepy the count warning come into my mind but i take a pleasure in disobey it the sense of sleep be upon i and with it the obstinacy which sleep bring as outrider the soft moonlight soothe and the wide expanse without give a sense of freedom which refresh i i determine not to return to night to the gloom haunt room but to sleep here where of old lady have sit and sing and live sweet life whilst their gentle breast be sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless war i draw a great couch out of its place near the corner so that as i lay i could look at the lovely view to east and south and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust compose myself for sleep i suppose i must have fall asleep i hope so but i fear for all that follow be startlingly real so real that now sit here in the broad full sunlight of the morning i can not in the least believe that it be all sleep i be not alone the room be the same unchanged in any way since i come into it i could see along the floor in the brilliant moonlight my own footstep mark where i have disturb the long accumulation of dust in the moonlight opposite i be three young woman lady by their dress and manner i think at the time that i must be dream when i see they for though the moonlight be behind they they throw no shadow on the floor they come close to i and look at i for some time and then whisper together two be dark and have high aquiline nose like the count and great dark pierce eye that seem to be almost red when contrast with the pale yellow moon the other be fair as fair as can be with great wavy mass of golden hair and eye like pale sapphire i seem somehow to know her face and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear but i could not recollect at the moment how or where all three have brilliant white tooth that shine like pearl against the ruby of their voluptuous lip there be something about they that make i uneasy some longing and at the same time some deadly fear i feel in my heart a wicked burn desire that they would kiss i with those red lip it be not good to note this down lest some day it should meet mina eye and cause her pain but it be the truth they whisper together and then they all three laugh such a silvery musical laugh but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lip it be like the intolerable tingle sweetness of water glass when play on by a cunning hand the fair girl shake her head coquettishly and the other two urge she on one go on you be first and we shall follow yours be the right to begin the other he be young and strong there be kiss for we all i lay quiet look out under my eyelash in an agony of delightful anticipation the fair girl advanced and bend over i till i could feel the movement of her breath upon i sweet it be in one sense honey sweet and send the same tingling through the nerve as her voice but with a bitter underlie the sweet a bitter offensiveness as one smell in blood i be afraid to raise my eyelid but look out and see perfectly under the lash the fair girl go on her knee and bend over i fairly gloating there be a deliberate voluptuousness which be both thrilling and repulsive and as she arch her neck she actually lick her lip like an animal till i could see in the moonlight the moisture shin on the scarlet lip and on the red tongue as it lap the white sharp tooth low and low go her head as the lip go below the range of my mouth and chin and seem about to fasten on my throat then she pause and i could hear the churn sound of her tongue as it lick her tooth and lip and could feel the hot breath on my neck then the skin of my throat begin to tingle as one flesh do when the hand that be to tickle it approach nearer nearer i could feel the soft shiver touch of the lip on the supersensitive skin of my throat and the hard dent of two sharp tooth just touch and pause there i close my eye in a languorous ecstasy and wait wait with beat heart but at that instant another sensation sweep through i as quick as lightning i be conscious of the presence of the count and of his being as if lap in a storm of fury as my eye open involuntarily i see his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant power draw it back the blue eye transform with fury the white tooth champ with rage and the fair cheek blaze red with passion but the count never do i imagine such wrath and fury even in the demon of the pit his eye be positively blaze the red light in they be lurid as if the flame of hell fire blaze behind they his face be deathly pale and the line of it be hard like draw wire the thick eyebrow that meet over the nose now seem like a heaving bar of white hot metal with a fierce sweep of his arm he hurl the woman from he and then motion to the other as though he be beat they back it be the same imperious gesture that i have see use to the wolf in a voice which though low and almost a whisper seem to cut through the air and then re round the room as he how dare you touch he any of you how dare you cast eye on he when i have forbid it back i tell you all this man belong to i beware how you meddle with he or you have to deal with i the fair girl with a laugh of ribald coquetry turn to answer you yourself never love you never love on this the other woman join and such a mirthless hard soulless laughter ring through the room that it almost make i faint to hear it seem like the pleasure of fiend then the count turn after look at my face attentively and say in a soft yes i too can love you yourselves can tell it from the past be it not so well now i promise you that when i be do with he you shall kiss he at your will now go go i must awaken he for there be work to be do be we to have nothing to night say one of they with a low laugh as she point to the bag which he have throw upon the floor and which move as though there be some live thing within it for answer he nod his head one of the woman jump forward and open it if my ear do not deceive i there be a gasp and a low wail as of a half smother child the woman close round whilst i be aghast with horror but as i look they disappear and with they the dreadful bag there be no door near they and they could not have pass i without my noticing they simply seem to fade into the ray of the moonlight and pass out through the window for i could see outside the dim shadowy form for a moment before they entirely fade away then the horror overcome i and i sink down unconscious,5704
4,CHAPTER 04,chapter iv jonathan harker i awake in my own bed if it be that i have not dream the count must have carry i here i try to satisfy myself on the subject but could not arrive at any unquestionable result to be sure there be certain small evidence such as that my clothe be fold and lay by in a manner which be not my habit my watch be still unwound and i be rigorously accustom to wind it the last thing before go to bed and many such detail but these thing be no proof for they may have be evidence that my mind be not as usual and from some cause or another i have certainly be much upset i must watch for proof of one thing i be glad if it be that the count carry i here and undress i he must have be hurry in his task for my pocket be intact i be sure this diary would have be a mystery to he which he would not have brook he would have take or destroy it as i look round this room although it have be to i so full of fear it be now a sort of sanctuary for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful woman who be who to suck my blood have be down to look at that room again in daylight for i must know the truth when i get to the doorway at the top of the stair i find it close it have be so forcibly drive against the jamb that part of the woodwork be splinter i could see that the bolt of the lock have not be shoot but the door be fasten from the inside i fear it be no dream and must act on this surmise be surely in the toil last night the count ask i in the suave tone to write three letter one say that my work here be nearly do and that i should start for home within a few day another that i be start on the next morning from the time of the letter and the third that i have leave the castle and arrive at bistritz i would fain have rebel but feel that in the present state of thing it would be madness to quarrel openly with the count whilst i be so absolutely in his power and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger he know that i know too much and that i must not live lest i be dangerous to he my only chance be to prolong my opportunity something may occur which will give i a chance to escape i see in his eye something of that gathering wrath which be manifest when he hurl that fair woman from he he explain to i that post be few and uncertain and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friend and he assure i with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letter which would be hold over at bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolong my stay that to oppose he would have be to create new suspicion i therefore pretend to fall in with his view and ask he what date i should put on the letter he calculate a minute and then the first should be june the second june and the third june i know now the span of my life god help i be a chance of escape or at any rate of be able to send word home a band of szgany have come to the castle and be encamp in the courtyard these szgany be gipsy i have note of they in my book they be peculiar to this part of the world though ally to the ordinary gipsy all the world over there be thousand of they in hungary and transylvania who be almost outside all law they attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar and call themselves by his name they be fearless and without religion save superstition and they talk only their own variety of the romany tongue i shall write some letter home and shall try to get they to have they post i have already speak to they through my window to begin an acquaintanceship they take their hat off and make obeisance and many sign which however i could not understand any more than i could their speak language i have write the letter mina be in shorthand and i simply ask hawkins to communicate with she to she i have explain my situation but without the horror which i may only surmise it would shock and frighten she to death be i to expose my heart to she should the letter not carry then the count shall not yet know my secret or the extent of my knowledge i have give the letter i throw they through the bar of my window with a gold piece and make what sign i could to have they post the man who take they press they to his heart and bow and then put they in his cap i could do no more i steal back to the study and begin to read as the count do not come in i have write here the count have come he sit down beside i and say in his smooth voice as he open two the szgany have give i these of which though i know not whence they come i shall of course take care must have look at be from you and to my friend peter hawkins the he catch sight of the strange symbol as he open the envelope and the dark look come into his face and his eye blaze other be a vile thing an outrage upon friendship and hospitality it be not sign well so it can not matter to we and he calmly hold letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they be consume then he go the letter to hawkins that i shall of course send on since it be yours your letter be sacred to i your pardon my friend that unknowingly i do break the seal will you not cover it again he hold out the letter to i and with a courteous bow hand i a clean envelope i could only redirect it and hand it to he in silence when he go out of the room i could hear the key turn softly a minute later i go over and try it and the door be lock when an hour or two after the count come quietly into the room his come waken i for i have go to sleep on the sofa he be very courteous and very cheery in his manner and see that i have be sleep he say so my friend you be tired get to bed there be the sure rest i may not have the pleasure to talk to night since there be many labour to i but you will sleep i pray i pass to my room and go to bed and strange to say sleep without dream despair have its own calm morning when i wake i think i would provide myself with some paper and envelope from my bag and keep they in my pocket so that i might write in case i should get an opportunity but again a surprise again a shock every scrap of paper be go and with it all my note my memoranda relate to railway and travel my letter of credit in fact all that might be useful to i be i once outside the castle i sit and ponder a while and then some thought occur to i and i make search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where i have place my clothe the suit in which i have travel be go and also my overcoat and rug i could find no trace of they anywhere this look like some new scheme of villainy morning as i be sit on the edge of my bed cudgel my brain i hear without a cracking of whip and pound and scraping of horse foot up the rocky path beyond the courtyard with joy i hurry to the window and see drive into the yard two great leiter waggon each draw by eight sturdy horse and at the head of each pair a slovak with his wide hat great nail stud belt dirty sheepskin and high boot they have also their long stave in hand i run to the door intend to descend and try and join they through the main hall as i think that way might be open for they again a shock my door be fasten on the outside then i run to the window and cry to they they look up at i stupidly and point but just then the hetman of the szgany come out and see they point to my window say something at which they laugh henceforth no effort of mine no piteous cry or agonised entreaty would make they even look at i they resolutely turn away the leiter waggon contain great square box with handle of thick rope these be evidently empty by the ease with which the slovaks handle they and by their resonance as they be roughly move when they be all unload and back in a great heap in one corner of the yard the slovaks be give some money by the szgany and spit on it for luck lazily go each to his horse head shortly afterwards i hear the cracking of their whip die away in the distance june before night the count leave i early and lock himself into his own room as soon as i dare i run up the wind stair and look out of the window which open south i think i would watch for the count for there be something go on the szgany be quarter somewhere in the castle and be do work of some kind i know it for now and then i hear a far away muffle sound as of mattock and spade and whatever it be it must be to the end of some ruthless villainy i have be at the window somewhat less than half an hour when i see something come out of the count window i draw back and watch carefully and see the whole man emerge it be a new shock to i to find that he have on the suit of clothe which i have wear whilst travel here and sling over his shoulder the terrible bag which i have see the woman take away there could be no doubt as to his quest and in my garb too this then be his new scheme of evil that he will allow other to see i as they think so that he may both leave evidence that i have be see in the town or village post my own letter and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attribute to i it make i rage to think that this can go on and whilst i be shut up here a veritable prisoner but without that protection of the law which be even a criminal right and consolation i think i would watch for the count return and for a long time sit doggedly at the window then i begin to notice that there be some quaint little speck float in the ray of the moonlight they be like the tiny grain of dust and they whirl round and gather in cluster in a nebulous sort of way i watch they with a sense of soothe and a sort of calm steal over i i lean back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position so that i could enjoy more fully the aerial gambolling something make i start up a low piteous howling of dog somewhere far below in the valley which be hide from my sight louder it seem to ring in my ear and the float mote of dust to take new shape to the sound as they dance in the moonlight i feel myself struggle to awake to some call of my instinct nay my very soul be struggle and my half remember sensibility be strive to answer the call i be become hypnotise quicker and quick dance the dust and the moonbeam seem to quiver as they go by i into the mass of gloom beyond more and more they gather till they seem to take dim phantom shape and then i start broad awake and in full possession of my sens and run scream from the place the phantom shape which be become gradually materialise from the moonbeam be those of the three ghostly woman to whom i be doom i flee and feel somewhat safe in my own room where there be no moonlight and where the lamp be burn brightly when a couple of hour have pass i hear something stir in the count room something like a sharp wail quickly suppress and then there be silence deep awful silence which chill i with a beat heart i try the door but i be lock in my prison and could do nothing i sit down and simply cry as i sit i hear a sound in the courtyard without the agonised cry of a woman i rush to the window and throw it up peer out between the bar there indeed be a woman with dishevel hair hold her hand over her heart as one distress with run she be lean against a corner of the gateway when she see my face at the window she throw herself forward and shout in a voice laden with monster give i my child she throw herself on her knee and raise up her hand cry the same word in tone which wring my heart then she tear her hair and beat her breast and abandon herself to all the violence of extravagant emotion finally she throw herself forward and though i could not see she i could hear the beating of her naked hand against the door somewhere high overhead probably on the tower i hear the voice of the count call in his harsh metallic whisper his call seem to be answer from far and wide by the howling of wolf before many minute have pass a pack of they pour like a pen up dam when liberate through the wide entrance into the courtyard there be no cry from the woman and the howling of the wolf be but short before long they stream away singly lick their lip i could not pity she for i know now what have become of her child and she be well dead what shall i do what can i do how can i escape from this dreadful thrall of night and gloom and fear june man know till he have suffer from the night how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be when the sun grow so high this morning that it strike the top of the great gateway opposite my window the high spot which it touch seem to i as if the dove from the ark have light there my fear fall from i as if it have be a vaporous garment which dissolve in the warmth i must take action of some sort while the courage of the day be upon i last night one of my post date letter go to post the first of that fatal series which be to blot out the very trace of my existence from the earth let i not think of it action it have always be at night time that i have be molest or threaten or in some way in danger or in fear i have not yet see the count in the daylight can it be that he sleep when other wake that he may be awake whilst they sleep if i could only get into his room but there be no possible way the door be always lock no way for i yes there be a way if one dare to take it where his body have go why may not another body go i have see he myself crawl from his window why should not i imitate he and go in by his window the chance be desperate but my need be more desperate still i shall risk it at the bad it can only be death and a man death be not a calf and the dread hereafter may still be open to i god help i in my task good bye mina if i fail good bye my faithful friend and second father good bye all and last of all mina same day have make the effort and god help i have come safely back to this room i must put down every detail in order i go whilst my courage be fresh straight to the window on the south side and at once get outside on the narrow ledge of stone which run round the building on this side the stone be big and roughly cut and the mortar have by process of time be wash away between they i take off my boot and venture out on the desperate way i look down once so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome i but after that keep my eye away from it i know pretty well the direction and distance of the count window and make for it as well as i could have regard to the opportunity available i do not feel dizzy i suppose i be too excited and the time seem ridiculously short till i find myself stand on the windowsill and try to raise up the sash i be fill with agitation however when i bent down and slide foot foremost in through the window then i look round for the count but with surprise and gladness make a discovery the room be empty it be barely furnish with odd thing which seem to have never be use the furniture be something the same style as that in the south room and be cover with dust i look for the key but it be not in the lock and i could not find it anywhere the only thing i find be a great heap of gold in one corner gold of all kind roman and british and austrian and hungarian and greek and turkish money cover with a film of dust as though it have lain long in the ground none of it that i notice be less than three hundred year old there be also chain and ornament some jewel but all of they old and stain at one corner of the room be a heavy door i try it for since i could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door which be the main object of my search i must make further examination or all my effort would be in vain it be open and lead through a stone passage to a circular stairway which go steeply down i descend mind carefully where i go for the stair be dark be only light by loophole in the heavy masonry at the bottom there be a dark tunnel like passage through which come a deathly sickly odour the odour of old earth newly turn as i go through the passage the smell grow close and heavy at last i pull open a heavy door which stand ajar and find myself in an old ruin chapel which have evidently be use as a graveyard the roof be break and in two place be step lead to vault but the ground have recently be dig over and the earth place in great wooden box manifestly those which have be bring by the slovaks there be nobody about and i make search for any further outlet but there be none then i go over every inch of the ground so as not to lose a chance i go down even into the vault where the dim light struggle although to do so be dread to my very soul into two of these i go but see nothing except fragment of old coffin and pile of dust in the third however i make a discovery there in one of the great box of which there be fifty in all on a pile of newly dig earth lie the count he be either dead or asleep i could not say which for the eye be open and stony but without the glassiness of death and the cheek have the warmth of life through all their pallor and the lip be as red as ever but there be no sign of movement no pulse no breath no beating of the heart i bent over he and try to find any sign of life but in vain he could not have lain there long for the earthy smell would have pass away in a few hour by the side of the box be its cover pierce with hole here and there i think he might have the key on he but when i go to search i see the dead eye and in they dead though they be such a look of hate though unconscious of i or my presence that i flee from the place and leave the count room by the window crawl again up the castle wall regain my own chamber i throw myself pant upon the bed and try to think day be the date of my last letter and the count have take step to prove that it be genuine for again i see he leave the castle by the same window and in my clothe as he go down the wall lizard fashion i wish i have a gun or some lethal weapon that i might destroy he but i fear that no weapon work alone by man hand would have any effect on he i dare not wait to see he return for i fear to see those weird sister i come back to the library and read there till i fall asleep i be awaken by the count who look at i as grimly as a man can look as he to morrow my friend we must part you return to your beautiful england i to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet your letter home have be despatch to morrow i shall not be here but all shall be ready for your journey in the morning come the szgany who have some labour of their own here and also come some slovaks when they have go my carriage shall come for you and shall bear you to the borgo pass to meet the diligence from bukovina to bistritz but i be in hope that i shall see more of you at castle dracula i suspect he and determine to test his sincerity sincerity it seem like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster so i ask he point why may i not go to night because dear sir my coachman and horse be away on a mission but i would walk with pleasure i want to get away at once he smile such a soft smooth diabolical smile that i know there be some trick behind his smoothness he and your baggage i do not care about it i can send for it some other time the count stand up and say with a sweet courtesy which make i rub my eye it seem so you english have a saying which be close to my heart for its spirit be that which rule our boyar welcome the come speed the parting guest come with i my dear young friend not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will though sad be i at your going and that you so suddenly desire it come with a stately gravity he with the lamp precede i down the stair and along the hall suddenly he stop hark close at hand come the howling of many wolf it be almost as if the sound spring up at the raising of his hand just as the music of a great orchestra seem to leap under the baton of the conductor after a pause of a moment he proceed in his stately way to the door draw back the ponderous bolt unhook the heavy chain and begin to draw it open to my intense astonishment i see that it be unlocked suspiciously i look all round but could see no key of any kind as the door begin to open the howling of the wolf without grow louder and angrier their red jaw with champ tooth and their blunt claw foot as they leap come in through the opening door i know that to struggle at the moment against the count be useless with such ally as these at his command i could do nothing but still the door continue slowly to open and only the count body stand in the gap suddenly it strike i that this might be the moment and the mean of my doom i be to be give to the wolf and at my own instigation there be a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the count and as a last chance i cry shut the door i shall wait till morning and cover my face with my hand to hide my tear of bitter disappointment with one sweep of his powerful arm the count throw the door shut and the great bolt clang and echo through the hall as they shoot back into their place in silence we return to the library and after a minute or two i go to my own room the last i see of count dracula be his kiss his hand to i with a red light of triumph in his eye and with a smile that judas in hell might be proud of when i be in my room and about to lie down i think i hear a whispering at my door i go to it softly and listen unless my ear deceive i i hear the voice of the back back to your own place your time be not yet come wait have patience to morrow night to morrow night be your there be a low sweet ripple of laughter and in a rage i throw open the door and see without the three terrible woman lick their lip as i appear they all join in a horrible laugh and run away i come back to my room and throw myself on my knee be it then so near the end to morrow to morrow lord help i and those to whom i be dear june may be the last word i ever write in this diary i sleep till just before the dawn and when i wake throw myself on my knee for i determine that if death come he should find i ready at last i feel that subtle change in the air and know that the morning have come then come the welcome cock crow and i feel that i be safe with a glad heart i open my door and run down the hall i have see that the door be unlocked and now escape be before i with hand that tremble with eagerness i unhook the chain and draw back the massive bolt but the door would not move despair seize i i pull and pull at the door and shake it till massive as it be it rattle in its casement i could see the bolt shot it have be lock after i leave the count then a wild desire take i to obtain that key at any risk and i determine then and there to scale the wall again and gain the count room he might kill i but death now seem the happy choice of evil without a pause i rush up to the east window and scramble down the wall as before into the count room it be empty but that be as i expect i could not see a key anywhere but the heap of gold remain i go through the door in the corner and down the wind stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel i know now well enough where to find the monster i seek the great box be in the same place close against the wall but the lid be lay on it not fasten down but with the nail ready in their place to be hammer home i know i must search the body for the key so i raise the lid and lay it back against the wall and then i see something which fill my very soul with horror there lie the count but look as if his youth have be half renew for the white hair and moustache be change to dark iron grey the cheek be full and the white skin seem ruby red underneath the mouth be red than ever for on the lip be gout of fresh blood which trickle from the corner of the mouth and run over the chin and neck even the deep burn eye seem set amongst swollen flesh for the lid and pouch underneath be bloat it seem as if the whole awful creature be simply gorge with blood he lie like a filthy leech exhaust with his repletion i shudder as i bent over to touch he and every sense in i revolt at the contact but i have to search or i be lose the come night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three i feel all over the body but no sign could i find of the key then i stop and look at the count there be a mocking smile on the bloated face which seem to drive i mad this be the being i be help to transfer to london where perhaps for century to come he might amongst its teem million satiate his lust for blood and create a new and ever widen circle of semi demon to batten on the helpless the very thought drive i mad a terrible desire come upon i to rid the world of such a monster there be no lethal weapon at hand but i seize a shovel which the workman have be use to fill the case and lift it high strike with the edge downward at the hateful face but as i do so the head turn and the eye fall full upon i with all their blaze of basilisk horror the sight seem to paralyse i and the shovel turn in my hand and glance from the face merely make a deep gash above the forehead the shovel fall from my hand across the box and as i pull it away the flange of the blade catch the edge of the lid which fall over again and hide the horrid thing from my sight the last glimpse i have be of the bloated face blood stain and fix with a grin of malice which would have hold its own in the nethermost hell i think and think what should be my next move but my brain seem on fire and i wait with a despairing feeling grow over i as i wait i hear in the distance a gipsy song sing by merry voice come close and through their song the rolling of heavy wheel and the cracking of whip the szgany and the slovaks of whom the count have speak be come with a last look round and at the box which contain the vile body i run from the place and gain the count room determine to rush out at the moment the door should be open with strained ear i listen and hear downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the fall back of the heavy door there must have be some other mean of entry or some one have a key for one of the locked door then there come the sound of many foot tramp and die away in some passage which send up a clanging echo i turn to run down again towards the vault where i might find the new entrance but at that moment there seem to come a violent puff of wind and the door to the wind stair blow to with a shock that set the dust from the lintel fly when i run to push it open i find that it be hopelessly fast i be again a prisoner and the net of doom be close round i more closely as i write there be in the passage below a sound of many tramping foot and the crash of weight be set down heavily doubtless the box with their freight of earth there be a sound of hammering it be the box be nail down now i can hear the heavy foot tramp again along the hall with many other idle foot come behind they the door be shut and the chain rattle there be a grinding of the key in the lock i can hear the key withdraw then another door open and shut i hear the creaking of lock and bolt hark in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheel the crack of whip and the chorus of the szgany as they pass into the distance i be alone in the castle with those awful woman faugh mina be a woman and there be naught in common they be devil of the pit i shall not remain alone with they i shall try to scale the castle wall far than i have yet attempt i shall take some of the gold with i lest i want it later i may find a way from this dreadful place and then away for home away to the quick and near train away from this cursed spot from this curse land where the devil and his child still walk with earthly foot at least god mercy be well than that of these monster and the precipice be steep and high at its foot a man may sleep as a man good bye all mina,5834

and say he hop i would be happy and that if i ever want a friend i must count he one of my good oh mina dear i can help cry and you must excuse this letter be all blot be propose to be all very nice

master of the fact of his hallucination in my manner of do it there be i now see something of cruelty i seem to wish to keep he to the point of his madness a thing which i avoid with the patient as i

6,CHAPTER 06,chapter vi murray july meet i at the station look sweet and lovely than ever and we drive up to the house at the crescent in which they have room this be a lovely place the little river the esk run through a deep valley which broaden out as it come near the harbour a great viaduct run across with high pier through which the view seem somehow far away than it really be the valley be beautifully green and it be so steep that when you be on the high land on either side you look right across it unless you be near enough to see down the house of the old town the side away from we be all red roofed and seem pile up one over the other anyhow like the picture we see of nuremberg right over the town be the ruin of whitby abbey which be sack by the danes and which be the scene of part of marmion where the girl be build up in the wall it be a most noble ruin of immense size and full of beautiful and romantic bit there be a legend that a white lady be see in one of the window between it and the town there be another church the parish one round which be a big graveyard all full of tombstone this be to my mind the nice spot in whitby for it lie right over the town and have a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland call kettleness stretch out into the sea it descend so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank have fall away and some of the graf have be destroy in one place part of the stonework of the graf stretch out over the sandy pathway far below there be walk with seat beside they through the churchyard and people go and sit there all day long look at the beautiful view and enjoy the breeze i shall come and sit here very often myself and work indeed i be write now with my book on my knee and listen to the talk of three old man who be sit beside i they seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk the harbour lie below i with on the far side one long granite wall stretch out into the sea with a curve outward at the end of it in the middle of which be a lighthouse a heavy sea wall run along outside of it on the near side the sea wall make an elbow crook inversely and its end too have a lighthouse between the two pier there be a narrow opening into the harbour which then suddenly widen it be nice at high tide but when the tide be out it shoal away to nothing and there be merely the stream of the esk run between bank of sand with rock here and there outside the harbour on this side there rise for about half a mile a great reef the sharp edge of which run straight out from behind the south lighthouse at the end of it be a buoy with a bell which swing in bad weather and send in a mournful sound on the wind they have a legend here that when a ship be lose bell be hear out at sea i must ask the old man about this he be come this way he be a funny old man he must be awfully old for his face be all gnarl and twist like the bark of a tree he tell i that he be nearly a hundred and that he be a sailor in the greenland fishing fleet when waterloo be fight he be i be afraid a very sceptical person for when i ask he about the bell at sea and the white lady at the abbey he say very i would fash masel about they miss they thing be all wear out mind i do say they never be but i do say that they be in my time they be all very well for comer and tripper an the like but not for a nice young lady like

feature of the place they lead from the town up to the church there be hundred of they i do not know how many and they wind up in a delicate curve the slope be so gentle that a horse could easily walk

by this come up here an hour ago with lucy and we have a most interesting talk with my old friend and the two other who always come and join he he be evidently the sir oracle of they and i should think must have be in his time a most dictatorial person he will not admit anything and downface everybody if he can out argue they he bully they and then take their silence for agreement with his view lucy be look sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock she have get a beautiful colour since she have be here i notice that the old man do not lose any time in come up and sit near she when we sit down she be so sweet with old people i think they all fall in love with she on the spot even my old man succumb and do not contradict she but give i double share instead i get he on the subject of the

clock have just strike nine i see the light scatter all over the town sometimes in row where the street be and sometimes singly they run right up the esk and die away in the curve of the valley to my left the view be cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next the abbey the sheep and lamb be bleat in the field away behind i and there be a clatter of a donkey hoof up the paved road below the band on the pier be play a harsh waltz in good time and far along the quay there be a salvation army meeting in a back street neither of the band hear the other but up here i hear and see they both i wonder where jonathan be and if he be think of i i wish he be here seward diary case of renfield grow more interesting the more i get to understand the man he have certain quality very largely develop selfishness secrecy and purpose i wish i could get at what be the object of the latter he seem to have some settle scheme of his own but what it be i do not yet know his redeem quality be a love of animal though indeed he have such curious turn in it that i sometimes imagine he be only abnormally cruel his pet be of odd sort just now his hobby be catch fly he have at present such a quantity that i have have myself to expostulate to my astonishment he do not break out into a fury as i expect but take the matter in simple seriousness he think for a moment and then say may i have three day i shall clear they away of course i say that would do i must watch he have turn his mind now to spider and have get several very big fellow in a box he keep feed they with his fly and the number of the latter be become sensibly diminish although he have use half his food in attract more fly from outside to his room spider be now become as great a nuisance as his fly and to day i tell he that he must get rid of they he look very sad at this so i say that he must clear out some of they at all event he cheerfully acquiesce in this and i give he the same time as before for reduction he disgust i much while with he for when a horrid blowfly bloat with some carrion food buzz into the room he catch it hold it exultingly for a few moment between his finger and thumb and before i know what he be go to do put it in his mouth and eat it i scold he for it but he argue quietly that it be very good and very wholesome that it be life strong life and give life to he this give i an idea or the rudiment of one i must watch how he get rid of his spider he have evidently some deep problem in his mind for he keep a little note book in which he be always jot down something whole page of it be fill with mass of figure generally single number add up in batch and then the total add in batch again as though he be focus some account as the auditor put it be a method in his madness and the rudimentary idea in my mind be grow it will be a whole idea soon and then oh unconscious cerebration you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother i keep away from my friend for a few day so that i might notice if there be any change thing remain as they be except that he have part with some of his pet and get a new one he have manage to get a sparrow and have already partially tame it his mean of taming be simple for already the spider have diminish those that do remain however be well feed for he still bring in the fly by tempt they with his food be progress my friend have now a whole colony of sparrow and his fly and spider be almost obliterate when i come in he run to i and say he want to ask i a great favour a very very great favour and as he speak he fawn on i like a dog i ask he what it be and he say with a sort of rapture in his voice and a kitten a nice little sleek playful kitten that i can play with and teach and feed and feed and feed i be not unprepared for this request for i have notice how his pet go on increase in size and vivacity but i do not care that his pretty family of tame sparrow should be wipe out in the same manner as the fly and the spider so i say i would see about it and ask he if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten his eagerness betray he as he oh yes i would like a cat i only ask for a kitten lest you should refuse i a cat no one would refuse i a kitten would they i shake my head and say that at present i fear it would not be possible but that i would see about it his face fall and i could see a warning of danger in it for there be a sudden fierce sidelong look which mean kill the man be an undeveloped homicidal maniac i shall test he with his present craving and see how it will work out then i shall know more have visit he again and find he sit in a corner brooding when i come in he throw himself on his knee before i and implore i to let he have a cat that his salvation depend upon it i be firm however and tell he that he could not have it whereupon he go without a word and sit down gnaw his finger in the corner where i have find he i shall see he in the morning early renfield very early before the attendant go his round find he up and hum a tune he be spread out his sugar which he have save in the window and be manifestly begin his fly catch again and begin it cheerfully and with a good grace i look around for his bird and not see they ask he where they be he reply without turn round that they have all fly away there be a few feather about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood i say nothing but go and tell the keeper to report to i if there be anything odd about he during the day attendant have just be to i to say that renfield have be very sick and have disgorge a whole lot of feather my belief be doctor he say that he have eat his bird and that he just take and eat they raw give renfield a strong opiate to night enough to make even he sleep and take away his pocket book to look at it the thought that have be buzz about my brain lately be complete and the theory prove my homicidal maniac be of a peculiar kind i shall have to invent a new classification for he and call he a zoophagous life eat maniac what he desire be to absorb as many life as he can and he have lay himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way he give many fly to one spider and many spider to one bird and then want a cat to eat the many bird what would have be his later step it would almost be worth while to complete the experiment it might be do if there be only a sufficient cause man sneer at vivisection and yet look at its result to day why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspect the knowledge of the brain have i even the secret of one such mind do i hold the key to the fancy of even one lunatic i might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compare with which burdon sanderson physiology or ferrier brain knowledge would be as nothing if only there be a sufficient cause i must not think too much of this or i may be tempt a good cause might turn the scale with i for may not i too be of an exceptional brain congenitally how well the man reason lunatic always do within their own scope i wonder at how many life he value a man or if at only one he have close the account most accurately and to day begin a new record how many of we begin a new record with each day of our life to i it seem only yesterday that my whole life end with my new hope and that truly i begin a new record so it will be until the great recorder sum i up and close my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss oh lucy lucy i can not be angry with you nor can i be angry with my friend whose happiness be yours but i must only wait on hopeless and work work work if i only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there a good unselfish cause to make i work that would be indeed happiness murray be anxious and it soothe i to express myself here it be like

the sea mist drift inland the horizon be lose in a grey mist all be vastness the cloud be pile up like giant rock and there be a brool over the sea that sound like some presage of doom dark figure be

7,CHAPTER 07,chapter vii from the dailygraph paste in mina murray journal from a correspondent whitby one of the great and suddenest storm on record have just be experience here with result both strange and unique the weather have be somewhat sultry but not to any degree uncommon in the month of august saturday evening be as fine as ever be know and the great body of holiday maker set out yesterday for visit to mulgrave woods robin hood bay rig mill runswick staithes and the various trip in the neighbourhood of whitby the steamer emma and scarborough make excursion along the coast and there be an unusual amount of tripping both to and from whitby the day be unusually fine till the afternoon when some of the gossip who frequent the east cliff churchyard and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east call attention to a sudden show of high in the sky to the north west the wind be then blow from the south west in the mild degree which in barometrical language be rank no light breeze the coastguard on duty at once make report and one old fisherman who for more than half a century have keep watch on weather sign from the east cliff foretell in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm the approach of sunset be so very beautiful so grand in its mass of splendidly coloured cloud that there be quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty before the sun dip below the black mass of kettleness standing boldly athwart the western sky its downward way be mark by myriad cloud of every sunset colour flame purple pink green violet and all the tint of gold with here and there mass not large but seemingly of absolute blackness in all sort of shape as well outline as colossal silhouette the experience be not lose on the painter and doubtless some of the sketch of the prelude to the great storm will grace the and wall in may next more than one captain make up his mind then and there that his cobble or his mule as they term the different class of boat would remain in the harbour till the storm have pass the wind fall away entirely during the evening and at midnight there be a dead calm a sultry heat and that prevail intensity which on the approach of thunder affect person of a sensitive nature there be but few light in sight at sea for even the coast steamer which usually hug the shore so closely keep well to seaward and but few fishing boat be in sight the only sail noticeable be a foreign schooner with all sail set which be seemingly go westward the foolhardiness or ignorance of her officer be a prolific theme for comment whilst she remain in sight and effort be make to signal she to reduce sail in face of her danger before the night shut down she be see with sail idly flap as she gently roll on the undulating swell of the sea as idle as a paint ship upon a paint ocean shortly before ten the stillness of the air grow quite oppressive and the silence be so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town be distinctly hear and the band on the pier with its lively french air be like a discord in the great harmony of nature silence a little after midnight come a strange sound from over the sea and high overhead the air begin to carry a strange faint hollow booming then without warn the tempest break with a rapidity which at the time seem incredible and even afterwards be impossible to realise the whole aspect of nature at once become convulse the wave rise in grow fury each over top its fellow till in a very few minute the lately glassy sea be like a roar and devouring monster white crest wave beat madly on the level sand and rush up the shelve cliff other break over the pier and with their spume sweep the lanthorn of the lighthouse which rise from the end of either pier of whitby harbour the wind roar like thunder and blow with such force that it be with difficulty that even strong man keep their foot or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchion it be find necessary to clear the entire pier from the mass of onlooker or else the fatality of the night would have be increase manifold to add to the difficulty and danger of the time mass of sea fog come drift inland white wet cloud which sweep by in ghostly fashion so dank and damp and cold that it need but little effort of imagination to think that the spirit of those lose at sea be touch their living brother with the clammy hand of death and many a one shudder as the wreath of sea mist sweep by at time the mist clear and the sea for some distance could be see in the glare of the lightning which now come thick and fast follow by such sudden peal of thunder that the whole sky overhead seem tremble under the shock of the footstep of the storm some of the scene thus reveal be of immeasurable grandeur and of absorb interest the sea run mountain high throw skyward with each wave mighty mass of white foam which the temp seem to snatch at and whirl away into space here and there a fishing boat with a rag of sail run madly for shelter before the blast now and again the white wing of a storm toss sea bird on the summit of the east cliff the new searchlight be ready for experiment but have not yet be try the officer in charge of it get it into work order and in the pause of the inrushing mist sweep with it the surface of the sea once or twice its service be most effective as when a fishing boat with gunwale under water rush into the harbour able by the guidance of the shelter light to avoid the danger of dash against the pier as each boat achieve the safety of the port there be a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore a shout which for a moment seem to cleave the gale and be then sweep away in its rush before long the searchlight discover some distance away a schooner with all sail set apparently the same vessel which have be notice early in the evening the wind have by this time back to the east and there be a shudder amongst the watcher on the cliff as they realise the terrible danger in which she now be between she and the port lie the great flat reef on which so many good ship have from time to time suffer and with the wind blow from its present quarter it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour it be now nearly the hour of high tide but the wave be so great that in their trough the shallow of the shore be almost visible and the schooner with all sail set be rush with such speed that in the word of one old salt she must fetch up somewhere if it be only in hell then come another rush of sea fog great than any hitherto a mass of dank mist which seem to close on all thing like a grey pall and leave available to man only the organ of hearing for the roar of the temp and the crash of the thunder and the booming of the mighty bellow come through the damp oblivion even louder than before the ray of the searchlight be keep fix on the harbour mouth across the east pier where the shock be expect and man wait breathless the wind suddenly shift to the north east and the remnant of the sea fog melt in the blast and then mirabile dictu between the pier leap from wave to wave as it rush at headlong speed sweep the strange schooner before the blast with all sail set and gain the safety of the harbour the searchlight follow she and a shudder run through all who see she for lash to the helm be a corpse with droop head which swing horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship no other form could be see on deck at all a great awe come on all as they realise that the ship as if by a miracle have find the harbour unsteered save by the hand of a dead man however all take place more quickly than it take to write these word the schooner pause not but rush across the harbour pitch herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel wash by many tide and many storm into the south east corner of the pier jut under the east cliff know locally as tate hill pier there be of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drive up on the sand heap every spar rope and stay be strained and some of the top hamper come crash down but strange of all the very instant the shore be touch an immense dog spring up on deck from below as if shoot up by the concussion and run forward jump from the bow on to the sand make straight for the steep cliff where the churchyard hang over the laneway to the east pier so steeply that some of the flat stean or through stone as they call they in the whitby vernacular actually project over where the sustain cliff have fall away it disappear in the darkness which seem intensify just beyond the focus of the searchlight it so happen that there be no one at the moment on tate hill pier as all those whose house be in close proximity be either in bed or be out on the height above thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour who at once run down to the little pier be the first to climb on board the man work the searchlight after scour the entrance of the harbour without see anything then turn the light on the derelict and keep it there the coastguard run aft and when he come beside the wheel bend over to examine it and recoil at once as though under some sudden emotion this seem to pique the general curiosity and quite a number of people begin to run it be a good way round from the west cliff by the drawbridge to tate hill pier but your correspondent be a fairly good runner and come well ahead of the crowd when i arrive however i find already assemble on the pier a crowd whom the coastguard and police refuse to allow to come on board by the courtesy of the chief boat man i be as your correspondent permit to climb on deck and be one of a small group who see that dead seaman whilst actually lash to the wheel it be no wonder that the coastguard be surprised or even awed for not often can such a sight have be see the man be simply fasten by his hand tie one over the other to a spoke of the wheel between the inner hand and the wood be a crucifix the set of bead on which it be fasten be around both wrist and wheel and all keep fast by the bind cord the poor fellow may have be seat at one time but the flap and buffeting of the sail have work through the rudder of the wheel and drag he to and fro so that the cord with which he be tie have cut the flesh to the bone accurate note be make of the state of thing and a doctor surgeon caffyn of east elliot place who come immediately after i declare after make examination that the man must have be dead for quite two day in his pocket be a bottle carefully cork empty save for a little roll of paper which prove to be the addendum to the log the coastguard say the man must have tie up his own hand fasten the knot with his tooth the fact that a coastguard be the first on board may save some complication later on in the admiralty court for the coastguard can not claim the salvage which be the right of the first civilian enter on a derelict already however the legal tongue be wag and one young law student be loudly assert that the right of the owner be already completely sacrifice his property be hold in contravention of the statute of mortmain since the tiller as emblemship if not proof of delegate possession be hold in a dead hand it be needless to say that the dead steersman have be reverently remove from the place where he hold his honourable watch and ward till death a steadfastness as noble as that of the young casabianca and place in the mortuary to await inquest already the sudden storm be pass and its fierceness be abate the crowd be scatter homeward and the sky be begin to redden over the yorkshire wold i shall send in time for your next issue further detail of the derelict ship which find her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm whitby sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night be almost more startling than the thing itself it turn out that the schooner be a russian from varna and be call the demeter she be almost entirely in ballast of silver sand with only a small amount of cargo a number of great wooden box fill with mould this cargo be consign to a whitby solicitor billington of the crescent who this morning go aboard and formally take possession of the good consign to he the russian consul too act for the charter party take formal possession of the ship and pay all harbour due etc nothing be talk about here to day except the strange coincidence the official of the board of trade have be most exact in see that every compliance have be make with exist regulation as the matter be to be a nine day wonder they be evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint a good deal of interest be abroad concern the dog which land when the ship strike and more than a few of the member of the which be very strong in whitby have try to befriend the animal to the general disappointment however it be not to be find it seem to have disappear entirely from the town it may be that it be frightened and make its way on to the moor where it be still hide in terror there be some who look with dread on such a possibility lest later on it should in itself become a danger for it be evidently a fierce brute early this morning a large dog a half breed mastiff belong to a coal merchant close to tate hill pier be find dead in the roadway opposite its master yard it have be fight and manifestly have have a savage opponent for its throat be tear away and its belly slit open as if with a savage claw the kindness of the board of trade inspector i have be permit to look over the log book of the demeter which be in order up to within three day but contain nothing of special interest except as to fact of miss man the great interest however be with regard to the paper find in the bottle which be to day produce at the inqu and a more strange narrative than the two between they unfold it have not be my lot to come across as there be no motive for concealment i be permit to use they and accordingly send you a rescript simply omit technical detail of seamanship and supercargo it almost seem as though the captain have be seize with some kind of mania before he have get well into blue water and that this have develop persistently throughout the voyage of course my statement must be take cum grano since i be write from the dictation of a clerk of the russian consul who kindly translate for i time be short of the demeter varna to whitby write july thing so strange happening that i shall keep accurate note henceforth till we land on july we finish take in cargo silver sand and box of earth at noon set sail east wind fresh crew five hand two

eight bell last night be relieve by abramoff but do not go to bunk man more downcast than ever all say they expect something of the kind but would not say more than that there be something aboard mate get very impatient with they fear some trouble ahead on july yesterday one of the man olgaren come to my cabin and in an awestruck way confide to i that he think there be a strange man aboard the ship he say that in his watch he have be shelter behind the deck house as there be a rain storm when he see a tall thin man who be not like any of the crew come up the companion way and go along the deck forward and disappear he follow cautiously but when he get to bow find no one and the hatchway be all close he be in a panic of superstitious fear and i be afraid the panic may spread to allay it i shall to day search entire ship carefully from stem to stern later in the day i get together the whole crew and tell they as they evidently think there be some one in the ship we should search from stem to stern first mate angry say it be folly and to yield to such foolish idea would demoralise the man say he would engage to keep they out of trouble with a handspike i let he take the helm while the rest begin thorough search all keep abreast with lantern we leave no corner unsearched as there be only the big wooden box there be no odd corner where a man could hide man much relieve when search over and go back to work cheerfully first mate scowl but say nothing weather last three day and all hand busy with sail no time to be frightened man seem to have forget their dread mate cheerful again and all on good term praise man for work in bad weather pass gibraltar and out through straits all well seem some doom over this ship already a hand short and enter on the bay of biscay with wild weather ahead and yet last night another man lose disappear like the first he come off his watch and be not see again man all in a panic of fear send a round robin ask to have double watch as they fear to be alone mate violent fear there will be some trouble as either he or the man will do some violence day in hell knock about in a sort of maelstrom and the wind a temp no sleep for any one man all wear out hardly know how to set a watch since no one fit to go on second mate volunteer to steer and watch and let man snatch a few hour sleep wind abate sea still terrific but feel they less as ship be steady tragedy have single watch to night as crew too tired to double when morning watch come on deck could find no one except steersman raise outcry and all come on deck thorough search but no one find be now without second mate and crew in a panic mate and i agree to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause night rejoiced we be near england weather fine all sail set retire wear out sleep soundly awake by mate tell i that both man on watch and steersman missing only self and mate and two hand leave to work ship day of fog and not a sail sight have hop when in the english channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere not have power to work sail have to run before wind dare not low as could not raise they again we seem to be drift to some terrible doom mate now more demoralised than either of they his strong nature seem to have work inwardly against himself man be beyond fear work stolidly and patiently with mind make up to bad they be russian he roumanian august up from few minute sleep by hear a cry seemingly outside my port could see nothing in fog rush on deck and run against mate tell i hear cry and run but no sign of man on watch one more go lord help we mate say we must be past straits of dover as in a moment of fog lifting he see north foreland just as he hear the man cry out if so we be now off in the north sea and only god can guide we in the fog which seem to move with we and god seem to have desert we midnight i go to relieve the man at the wheel but when i get to it find no one there the wind be steady and as we run before it there be no yawing i dare not leave it so shout for the mate after a few second he rush up on deck in his flannel he look wild eyed and haggard and i greatly fear his reason have give way he come close to i and whisper hoarsely with his mouth to my ear as though fear the very air might hear it be here i know it now on the watch last night i see it like a man tall and thin and ghastly pale it be in the bow and look out i creep behind it and give it my knife but the knife go through it empty as the air and as he speak he take his knife and drive it savagely into space then he go on but it be here and i find it it be in the hold perhaps in one of those box i unscrew they one by one and see you work the helm and with a warning look and his finger on his lip he go below there be spring up a choppy wind and i could not leave the helm i see he come out on deck again with a tool chest and a lantern and go down the forward hatchway he be mad stark rave mad and it no use my try to stop he he can hurt those big box they be invoice as clay and to pull they about be as harmless a thing as he can do so here i stay and mind the helm and write these note i can only trust in god and wait till the fog clear then if i can steer to any harbour with the wind that be i shall cut down sail and lie by and signal for help it be nearly all over now just as i be begin to hope that the mate would come out calm for i hear he knock away at something in the hold and work be good for he there come up the hatchway a sudden startled scream which make my blood run cold and up on the deck he come as if shoot from a gun a rag madman with his eye roll and his face convulse with fear save i save i he cry and then look round on the blanket of fog his horror turn to despair and in a steady voice he say you have well come too captain before it be too late he be there i know the secret now the sea will save i from he and it be all that be leave before i could say a word or move forward to seize he he spring on the bulwark and deliberately throw himself into the sea i suppose i know the secret too now it be this madman who have get rid of the man one by one and now he have follow they himself god help i how be i to account for all these horror when i get to port when i get to port will that ever be fog which the sunrise can not pierce i know there be sunrise because i be a sailor why else i know not i dare not go below i dare not leave the helm so here all night i stay and in the dimness of the night i see it him god forgive i but the mate be right to jump overboard it be well to die like a man to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object but i be captain and i must not leave my ship but i shall baffle this fiend or monster for i shall tie my hand to the wheel when my strength begin to fail and along with they i shall tie that which he not touch and then come good wind or foul i shall save my soul and my honour as a captain i be grow weak and the night be come on if he can look i in the face again i may not have time to act if we be wreck mayhap this bottle may be find and those who find it may understand if not well then all man shall know that i have be true to my trust god and the blessed virgin and the saint help a poor ignorant soul try to do his duty of course the verdict be an open one there be no evidence to adduce and whether or not the man himself commit the murder there be now none to say the folk hold almost universally here that the captain be simply a hero and he be to be give a public funeral already it be arrange that his body be to be take with a train of boat up the esk for a piece and then bring back to tate hill pier and up the abbey step for he be to be bury in the churchyard on the cliff the owner of more than a hundred boat have already give in their name as wish to follow he to the grave no trace have ever be find of the great dog at which there be much mourning for with public opinion in its present state he would i believe be adopt by the town to morrow will see the funeral and so will end this one more mystery of the sea murray be very restless all night and i too could not sleep the storm be fearful and as it boom loudly among the chimney pot it make i shudder when a sharp puff come it seem to be like a distant gun strangely enough lucy do not wake but she get up twice and dress herself fortunately each time i awake in time and manage to undress she without wake she and get she back to bed it be a very strange thing this sleep walking for as soon as she will be thwart in any physical way her intention if there be any disappear and she yield herself almost exactly to the routine of her life early in the morning we both get up and go down to the harbour to see if anything have happen in the night there be very few people about and though the sun be bright and the air clear and fresh the big grim look wave that seem dark themselves because the foam that top they be like snow force themselves in through the narrow mouth of the harbour like a bullying man go through a crowd somehow i feel glad that jonathan be not on the sea last night but on land but oh be he on land or sea where be he and how i be get fearfully anxious about he if i only know what to do and could do anything funeral of the poor sea captain to day be most touching every boat in the harbour seem to be there and the coffin be carry by captain all the way from tate hill pier up to the churchyard lucy come with i and we go early to our old seat whilst the cortège of boat go up the river to the viaduct and come down again we have a lovely view and see the procession nearly all the way the poor fellow be lay to rest quite near our seat so that we stand on it when the time come and see everything poor lucy seem much upset she be restless and uneasy all the time and i can not but think that her dream at night be tell on she she be quite odd in one thing she will not admit to i that there be any cause for restlessness or if there be she do not understand it herself there be an additional cause in that poor old swales be find dead this morning on our seat his neck be break he have evidently as the doctor say fall back in the seat in some sort of fright for there be a look of fear and horror on his face that the man say make they shudder poor dear old man perhaps he have see death with his die eye lucy be so sweet and sensitive that she feel influence more acutely than other people do just now she be quite upset by a little thing which i do not much heed though i be myself very fond of animal one of the man who come up here often to look for the boat be follow by his dog the dog be always with he they be both quiet person and i never see the man angry nor hear the dog bark during the service the dog would not come to its master who be on the seat with we but keep a few yard off bark and howling its master speak to it gently and then harshly and then angrily but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise it be in a sort of fury with its eye savage and all its hair bristle out like a cat tail when puss be on the war path finally the man too get angry and jump down and kick the dog and then take it by the scruff of the neck and half drag and half throw it on the tombstone on which the seat be fix the moment it touch the stone the poor thing become quiet and fall all into a tremble it do not try to get away but crouch down quiver and cower and be in such a pitiable state of terror that i try though without effect to comfort it lucy be full of pity too but she do not attempt to touch the dog but look at it in an agonise sort of way i greatly fear that she be of too supersensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble she will be dream of this to night i be sure the whole agglomeration of thing the ship steer into port by a dead man his attitude tie to the wheel with a crucifix and bead the touching funeral the dog now furious and now in terror will all afford material for her dream i think it will be good for she to go to bed tired out physically so i shall take she for a long walk by the cliff to robin hood bay and back she ought not to have much inclination for sleep walk then,5567
8,CHAPTER 08,chapter viii murray same day but i be tired if it be not that i have make my diary a duty i should not open it to night we have a lovely walk lucy after a while be in gay spirit owe i think to some dear cow who come nose towards we in a field close to the lighthouse and frighten the wit out of we i believe we forgot everything except of course personal fear and it seem to wipe the slate clean and give we a fresh start we have a capital severe tea at robin hood bay in a sweet little old fashioned inn with a bow window right over the seaweed cover rock of the strand i believe we should have shock the new woman with our appetite man be more tolerant bless they then we walk home with some or rather many stoppage to rest and with our heart full of a constant dread of wild bull lucy be really tired and we intend to creep off to bed as soon as we could the young curate come in however and westenra ask he to stay for supper lucy and i have both a fight for it with the dusty miller i know it be a hard fight on my part and i be quite heroic i think that some day the bishop must get together and see about breed up a new class of curate who do take supper no matter how they may be press to and who will know when girl be tired lucy be asleep and breathe softly she have more colour in her cheek than usual and look oh so sweet if holmwood fall in love with she see she only in the drawing room i wonder what he would say if he see she now some of the new women writer will some day start an idea that man and woman should be allow to see each other asleep before propose or accept but i suppose the new woman will condescend in future to accept she will do the propose herself and a nice job she will make of it too there some consolation in that i be so happy to night because dear lucy seem well i really believe she have turn the corner and that we be over her trouble with dream i should be quite happy if i only know if jonathan god bless and keep he august again no sleep now so i may as well write i be too agitated to sleep we have have such an adventure such an agonising experience i fall asleep as soon as i have close my diary suddenly i become broad awake and sit up with a horrible sense of fear upon i and of some feeling of emptiness around i the room be dark so i could not see lucy bed i steal across and feel for she the bed be empty i light a match and find that she be not in the room the door be shut but not lock as i have leave it i fear to wake her mother who have be more than usually ill lately so throw on some clothe and get ready to look for she as i be leave the room it strike i that the clothe she wear might give i some clue to her dream intention dressing gown would mean house dress outside dressing gown and dress be both in their place thank god i say to myself she can not be far as she be only in her nightdress i run downstairs and look in the sitting room not there then i look in all the other open room of the house with an ever grow fear chill my heart finally i come to the hall door and find it open it be not wide open but the catch of the lock have not catch the people of the house be careful to lock the door every night so i fear that lucy must have go out as she be there be no time to think of what might happen a vague overmaster fear obscure all detail i take a big heavy shawl and run out the clock be strike one as i be in the crescent and there be not a soul in sight i run along the north terrace but could see no sign of the white figure which i expect at the edge of the west cliff above the pier i look across the harbour to the east cliff in the hope or fear i do know which of see lucy in our favourite seat there be a bright full moon with heavy black drive cloud which throw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sail across for a moment or two i could see nothing as the shadow of a cloud obscure mary church and all around it then as the cloud pass i could see the ruin of the abbey come into view and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword cut move along the church and the churchyard become gradually visible whatever my expectation be it be not disappointed for there on our favourite seat the silver light of the moon strike a half recline figure snowy white the coming of the cloud be too quick for i to see much for shadow shut down on light almost immediately but it seem to i as though something dark stand behind the seat where the white figure shine and bend over it what it be whether man or beast i could not tell i do not wait to catch another glance but fly down the steep step to the pier and along by the fish market to the bridge which be the only way to reach the east cliff the town seem as dead for not a soul do i see i rejoice that it be so for i want no witness of poor lucy condition the time and distance seem endless and my knee tremble and my breath come labour as i toil up the endless step to the abbey i must have go fast and yet it seem to i as if my foot be weight with lead and as though every joint in my body be rusty when i get almost to the top i could see the seat and the white figure for i be now close enough to distinguish it even through the spell of shadow there be undoubtedly something long and black bend over the half recline white figure i call in fright lucy lucy and something raise a head and from where i be i could see a white face and red gleam eye lucy do not answer and i run on to the entrance of the churchyard as i enter the church be between i and the seat and for a minute or so i lose sight of she when i come in view again the cloud have pass and the moonlight strike so brilliantly that i could see lucy half recline with her head lie over the back of the seat she be quite alone and there be not a sign of any live thing about when i bent over she i could see that she be still asleep her lip be part and she be breathe not softly as usual with she but in long heavy gasp as though strive to get her lung full at every breath as i come close she put up her hand in her sleep and pull the collar of her nightdress close round her throat whilst she do so there come a little shudder through she as though she feel the cold i fling the warm shawl over she and draw the edge tight round her neck for i dread lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air unclad as she be i fear to wake she all at once so in order to have my hand free that i might help she i fasten the shawl at her throat with a big safety pin but i must have be clumsy in my anxiety and pinch or prick she with it for by and by when her breathing become quieter she put her hand to her throat again and moan when i have she carefully wrap up i put my shoe on her foot and then begin very gently to wake she at first she do not respond but gradually she become more and more uneasy in her sleep moan and sigh occasionally at last as time be pass fast and for many other reason i wish to get her home at once i shake she more forcibly till finally she open her eye and awake she do not seem surprised to see i as of course she do not realise all at once where she be lucy always wake prettily and even at such a time when her body must have be chill with cold and her mind somewhat appal at wake unclad in a churchyard at night she do not lose her grace she tremble a little and clung to i when i tell she to come at once with i home she rise without a word with the obedience of a child as we pass along the gravel hurt my foot and lucy notice i wince she stop and want to insist upon my take my shoe but i would not however when we get to the pathway outside the churchyard where there be a puddle of water remain from the storm i daub my foot with mud use each foot in turn on the other so that as we go home no one in case we should meet any one should notice my bare foot fortune favour we and we get home without meet a soul once we see a man who seem not quite sober pass along a street in front of we but we hide in a door till he have disappear up an opening such as there be here steep little close or wynd as they call they in scotland my heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes i think i should faint i be fill with anxiety about lucy not only for her health lest she should suffer from the exposure but for her reputation in case the story should get wind when we get in and have wash our foot and have say a prayer of thankfulness together i tuck she into bed before fall asleep she ask even implore i not to say a word to any one even her mother about her sleep walk adventure i hesitate at first to promise but on thinking of the state of her mother health and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret she and think too of how such a story might become distort nay infallibly would in case it should leak out i think it wiser to do so i hope i do right i have lock the door and the key be tie to my wrist so perhaps i shall not be again disturb lucy be sleep soundly the reflex of the dawn be high and far over the sea same day go well lucy sleep till i wake she and seem not to have even change her side the adventure of the night do not seem to have harm she on the contrary it have benefit she for she look well this morning than she have do for week i be sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety pin hurt she indeed it might have be serious for the skin of her throat be pierce i must have pinch up a piece of loose skin and have transfix it for there be two little red point like pin prick and on the band of her nightdress be a drop of blood when i apologise and be concerned about it she laugh and pet i and say she do not even feel it fortunately it can not leave a scar as it be so tiny same day pass a happy day the air be clear and the sun bright and there be a cool breeze we take our lunch to mulgrave woods westenra drive by the road and lucy and i walk by the cliff path and join she at the gate i feel a little sad myself for i could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have be have jonathan be with i but there i must only be patient in the evening we stroll in the casino terrace and hear some good music by spohr and mackenzie and go to bed early lucy seem more restful than she have be for some time and fall asleep at once i shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before though i do not expect any trouble to night expectation be wrong for twice during the night i be awaken by lucy try to get out she seem even in her sleep to be a little impatient at find the door shut and go back to bed under a sort of protest i wake with the dawn and hear the bird chirp outside of the window lucy wake too and i be glad to see be even well than on the previous morning all her old gaiety of manner seem to have come back and she come and snuggle in beside i and tell i all about arthur i tell she how anxious i be about jonathan and then she try to comfort i well she succeed somewhat for though sympathy can alter fact it can help to make they more bearable quiet day and to bed with the key on my wrist as before again i wake in the night and find lucy sit up in bed still asleep point to the window i get up quietly and pull aside the blind look out it be brilliant moonlight and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky merge together in one great silent mystery be beautiful beyond word between i and the moonlight flit a great bat come and go in great whirling circle once or twice it come quite close but be i suppose frighten at see i and flit away across the harbour towards the abbey when i come back from the window lucy have lain down again and be sleep peacefully she do not stir again all night the east cliff read and write all day lucy seem to have become as much in love with the spot as i be and it be hard to get she away from it when it be time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner this afternoon she make a funny remark we be come home for dinner and have come to the top of the step up from the west pier and stop to look at the view as we generally do the set sun low down in the sky be just drop behind kettleness the red light be throw over on the east cliff and the old abbey and seem to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow we be silent for a while and suddenly lucy murmur as if to his red eye again they be just the same it be such an odd expression come apropos of nothing that it quite startle i i slew round a little so as to see lucy well without seem to stare at she and see that she be in a half dreamy state with an odd look on her face that i could not quite make out so i say nothing but follow her eye she appear to be look over at our seat whereon be a dark figure seat alone i be a little startled myself for it seem for an instant as if the stranger have great eye like burn flame but a second look dispel the illusion the red sunlight be shin on the window of mary church behind our seat and as the sun dip there be just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light move i call lucy attention to the peculiar effect and she become herself with a start but she look sad all the same it may have be that she be think of that terrible night up there we never refer to it so i say nothing and we go home to dinner lucy have a headache and go early to bed i see her asleep and go out for a little stroll myself i walk along the cliff to the westward and be full of sweet sadness for i be think of jonathan when come home it be then bright moonlight so bright that though the front of our part of the crescent be in shadow everything could be well see i throw a glance up at our window and see lucy head lean out i think that perhaps she be look out for i so i open my handkerchief and wave it she do not notice or make any movement whatever just then the moonlight creep round an angle of the building and the light fall on the window there distinctly be lucy with her head lie up against the side of the window sill and her eye shut she be fast asleep and by she seat on the window sill be something that look like a good sized bird i be afraid she might get a chill so i run upstairs but as i come into the room she be move back to her bed fast asleep and breathe heavily she be hold her hand to her throat as though to protect it from cold i do not wake she but tuck she up warmly i have take care that the door be lock and the window securely fasten she look so sweet as she sleep but she be pale than be she will not and there be a draw haggard look under her eye which i do not like i fear she be fret about something i wish i could find out what it be later than usual lucy be languid and tired and sleep on after we have be call we have a happy surprise at breakfast arthur father be well and want the marriage to come off soon lucy be full of quiet joy and her mother be glad and sorry at once later on in the day she tell i the cause she be grieve to lose lucy as her very own but she be rejoice that she be soon to have some one to protect she poor dear sweet lady she confide to i that she have get her death warrant she have not tell lucy and make i promise secrecy her doctor tell she that within a few month at most she must die for her heart be weaken at any time even now a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill she ah we be wise to keep from she the affair of the dreadful night of lucy sleep walking diary for two whole day i have not have the heart to write some sort of shadowy pall seem to be come over our happiness no news from jonathan and lucy seem to be grow weak whilst her mother hour be number to a close i do not understand lucy fade away as she be do she eat well and sleep well and enjoy the fresh air but all the time the rose in her cheek be fade and she get weak and more languid day by day at night i hear she gasp as if for air i keep the key of our door always fasten to my wrist at night but she get up and walk about the room and sit at the open window last night i find she lean out when i wake up and when i try to wake she i could not she be in a faint when i manage to restore she she be as weak as water and cry silently between long painful struggle for breath when i ask she how she come to be at the window she shake her head and turn away i trust her feel ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safety pin i look at her throat just now as she lie asleep and the tiny wound seem not to have heal they be still open and if anything large than before and the edge of they be faintly white they be like

set the attendant be strike by his manner and know my interest in he encourage he to talk he be usually respectful to the attendant and at time servile but to night the man tell i he be quite haughty would not condescend to talk with he at all all he would say i do want to talk to you you do count now the master be at hand the attendant think it be some sudden form of religious mania which have seize he if so we must look out for squall for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous the combination be a dreadful one at nine i visit he myself his attitude to i be the same as that to the attendant in his sublime self feel the difference between myself and attendant seem to he as nothing it look like religious mania and he will soon think that he himself be god these infinitesimal distinction between man and man be too paltry for an omnipotent being how these madman give themselves away the real god taketh hee lest a sparrow fall but the god create from human vanity see no difference between an eagle and a sparrow oh if man only know for half an hour or more renfield keep get excited in great and great degree i do not pretend to be watch he but i keep strict observation all the same all at once that shifty look come into his eye which we always see when a madman have seize an idea and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendant come to know so well he become quite quiet and go and sit on the edge of his bed resignedly and look into space with lack lustre eye i think i would find out if his apathy be real or only assume and try to lead he to talk of his pet a theme which never fail to excite his attention at first he make no reply but at length say bother they all i do care a pin about they what i say you do mean to tell i that you do care about spider spider at present be his hobby and the note book be fill up with column of small figure to this he answer the bride maiden rejoice the eye that wait the coming of the bride but when the bride draweth nigh then the maidens shine not to the eye that be fill he would not explain himself but remain obstinately seat on his bed all the time i remain with he i be weary to night and low in spirit i can not but think of lucy and how different thing might have be if i do sleep at once chloral the modern morpheus i must be careful not to let it grow into a habit no i shall take none to night i have think of lucy and i shall not dishonour she by mix the two if need be to night shall be sleepless glad i make the resolution gladder that i keep to it i have lain toss about and have hear the clock strike only twice when the night watchman come to i send up from the ward to say that renfield have escape i throw on my clothe and run down at once my patient be too dangerous a person to be roam about those idea of his might work out dangerously with stranger the attendant be wait for i he say he have see he not ten minute before seemingly asleep in his bed when he have look through the observation trap in the door his attention be call by the sound of the window be wrench out he run back and see his foot disappear through the window and have at once send up for i he be only in his night gear and can not be far off the attendant think it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow he as he might lose sight of he whilst get out of the building by the door he be a bulky man and could get through the window i be thin so with his aid i get out but foot foremost and as we be only a few foot above ground land unhurt the attendant tell i the patient have go to the left and have take a straight line so i run as quickly as i could as i get through the belt of tree i see a white figure scale the high wall which separate our ground from those of the deserted house i run back at once and tell the watchman to get three or four man immediately and follow i into the ground of carfax in case our friend might be dangerous i get a ladder myself and cross the wall drop down on the other side i could see renfield figure just disappear behind the angle of the house so i run after he on the far side of the house i find he press close against the old iron bind oak door of the chapel he be talk apparently to some one but i be afraid to go near enough to hear what he be say lest i might frighten he and he should run off chase an errant swarm of bee be nothing to follow a naked lunatic when the fit of escape be upon he after a few minute however i could see that he do not take note of anything around he and so venture to draw nearer to he the more so as my man have now cross the wall and be close he in i hear he i be here to do your bidding master i be your slave and you will reward i for i shall be faithful i have worship you long and afar off now that you be near i await your command and you will not pass i by will you dear master in your distribution of good thing he be a selfish old beggar anyhow he think of the loaf and fish even when he believe he be in a real presence his mania make a startling combination when we close in on he he fight like a tiger he be immensely strong and he be more like a wild beast than a man i never see a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before and i hope i shall not again it be a mercy that we have find out his strength and his danger in good time with strength and determination like his he might have do wild work before he be cage he be safe now at any rate jack sheppard himself could get free from the strait waistcoat that keep he restrain and he chain to the wall in the padded room his cry be at time awful but the silence that follow be more deadly still for he mean murder in every turn and movement just now he speak coherent word for the first i shall be patient master it be come come come so i take the hint and come too i be too excited to sleep but this diary have quiet i and i feel i shall get some sleep to night,6265

have no special disease but she look awful and be get bad every day i have ask she if there be any cause i do not dare to ask her mother for to disturb the poor lady mind about her daughter in her present state of health would be fatal westenra have confide to i that her doom be speak disease of the heart though poor lucy do not know it yet i be sure that there be something preying on my dear girl mind i be almost distracted when i think of she to look at she give i a pang i tell she i should ask you to see she and though she demur at first i know why old fellow she finally consent it will be a painful task for you i know old friend but it be for her sake and i must not hesitate to ask or you to act you be to come to lunch at hillingham tomorrow two so as not to arouse any suspicion in westenra and after lunch lucy will take an opportunity of be alone with you i shall come in for tea and we can go away together i be fill with anxiety and want to consult with you alone as soon as i can after you have see she do not fail telegram arthur holmwood to seward september be summon to see my father who be bad be write write i fully by to night post to ring wire i if necessary letter from seward to arthur holmwood september my dear old with regard to miss westenra health i hasten to let you know at once that in my opinion there be not any functional disturbance or any malady that i know of at the same time i be not by any mean satisfied with her appearance she be woefully different from what she be when i see she last of course you must bear in mind that i do not have full opportunity of examination such as i should wish our very friendship make a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can bridge over i have well tell you exactly what happen leave you to draw in a measure your own conclusion i shall then say what i have do and propose do i find miss westenra in seemingly gay spirit her mother be present and in a few second i make up my mind that she be try all she know to mislead her mother and prevent she from be anxious i have no doubt she guess if she do not know what need of caution there be we lunch alone and as we all exert ourselves to be cheerful we get as some kind of reward for our labour some real cheerfulness amongst we then westenra go to lie down and lucy be leave with i we go into her boudoir and till we get there her gaiety remain for the servant be come and go as soon as the door be close however the mask fall from her face and she sink down into a chair with a great sigh and hide her eye with her hand when i see that her high spirit have fail i at once take advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis she say to i very i can not tell you how i loathe talk about myself i remind she that a doctor confidence be sacred but that you be grievously anxious about she she catch on to my meaning at once and settle that matter in a word tell arthur everything you choose i do not care for myself but all for he so i be quite free i could easily see that she be somewhat bloodless but i could not see the usual anæmic sign and by a chance i be actually able to test the quality of her blood for in open a window which be stiff a cord give way and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass it be a slight matter in itself but it give i an evident chance and i secure a few drop of the blood and have analyse they the qualitative analysis give a quite normal condition and show i should infer in itself a vigorous state of health in other physical matter i be quite satisfied that there be no need for anxiety but as there must be a cause somewhere i have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental she complain of difficulty in breathe satisfactorily at time and of heavy lethargic sleep with dream that frighten she but regard which she can remember nothing she say that as a child she use to walk in her sleep and that when in whitby the habit come back and that once she walk out in the night and go to the east cliff where miss murray find she but she assure i that of late the habit have not return i be in doubt and so have do the good thing i know of i have write to my old friend and master professor van helsing of amsterdam who know as much about obscure disease as any one in the world i have ask he to come over and as you tell i that all thing be to be at your charge i have mention to he who you be and your relation to miss westenra this my dear fellow be only in obedience to your wish for i be only too proud and happy to do anything i can for she van helsing would i know do anything for i for a personal reason so no matter on what ground he come we must accept his wish he be a seemingly arbitrary man but this be because he know what he be talk about well than any one else he be a philosopher and a metaphysician and one of the most advanced scientist of his day and he have i believe an absolutely open mind this with an iron nerve a temper of the ice brook an indomitable resolution self command and toleration exalt from virtue to blessing and the kind and true heart that beat these form his equipment for the noble work that he be do for mankind work both in theory and practice for his view be as wide as his all embrace sympathy i tell you these fact that you may know why i have such confidence in he i have ask he to come at once i shall see miss westenra to morrow again she be to meet i at the stores so that i may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call your always letter abraham van helsing etc etc to seward september my good when i have receive your letter i be already come to you by good fortune i can leave just at once without wrong to any of those who have trust i be fortune other then it be bad for those who

come have then room for i at the great eastern hotel so that i may be near to hand and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too late on tomorrow for it be likely that i may have to return here that night but if need be i shall come again in three day and stay long if it must till then good bye my friend john letter seward to hon arthur holmwood september my dear van helsing have come and go he come on with i to hillingham and find that by lucy discretion her mother be lunch out so that we be alone with she van helsing make a very careful examination of the patient he be to report to i and i shall advise you for of course i be not present all the time he be i fear much concerned but say he must think when i tell he of our friendship and how you trust to i in the matter he say you must tell he all you think tell he what i think if you can guess it if you will nay i be not jest this be no jest but life and death perhaps more i ask what he mean by that for he be very serious this be when we have come back to town and he be have a cup of tea before start on his return to amsterdam he would not give i any further clue you must not be angry with he art because his very reticence mean that all his brain be work for her good he will speak plainly enough when the time come be sure so i tell he i would simply write an account of our visit just as if i be do a descriptive special article for the daily telegraph he seem not to notice but remark that the smut in london be not quite so bad as they use to be when he be a student here i be to get his report to morrow if he can possibly make it in any case i be to have a letter well as to the visit lucy be more cheerful than on the day i first see she and certainly look well she have lose something of the ghastly look that so upset you and her breathing be normal she be very sweet to the professor as she always be and try to make he feel at ease though i could see that the poor girl be make a hard struggle for it i believe van helsing see it too for i see the quick look under his bushy brow that i know of old then he begin to chat of all thing except ourselves and disease and with such an infinite geniality that i could see poor lucy pretence of animation merge into reality then without any seeming change he bring the conversation gently round to his visit and suavely my dear young miss i have the so great pleasure because you be much beloved that be much my dear even be there that which i do not see they tell i you be down in the spirit and that you be of a ghastly pale to they i say pouf and he snap his finger at i and go on but you and i shall show they how wrong they be how can he point at i with the same look and gesture as that with which once he point i out to his class on or rather after a particular occasion which he never fail to remind i anything of a young lady he have his madman to play with and to bring they back to happiness and to those that love they it be much to do and oh but there be reward in that we can bestow such happiness but the young lady he have no wife nor daughter and the young do not tell themselves to the young but to the old like i who have know so many sorrow and the cause of they so my dear we will send he away to smoke the cigarette in the garden while you and i have little talk all to ourselves i take the hint and stroll about and presently the professor come to the window and call i in he look grave but say i have make careful examination but there be no functional cause with you i agree that there have be much blood lose it have be but be not but the condition of she be in no way anæmic i have ask she to send i her maid that i may ask just one or two question that so i may not chance to miss nothing i know well what she will say and yet there be cause there be always cause for everything i must go back home and think you must send to i the telegram every day and if there be cause i shall come again the disease for not to be all well be a disease interest i and the sweet young dear she interest i too she charm i and for she if not for you or disease i come as i tell you he would not say a word more even when we be alone and so now art you know all i know i shall keep stern watch i trust your poor father be rally it must be a terrible thing to you my dear old fellow to be place in such a position between two people who be both so dear to you i know your idea of duty to your father and you be right to stick to it but if need be i shall send you word to come at once to lucy so do not be over anxious unless you hear from i seward diary patient still keep up our interest in he he have only one outburst and that be yesterday at an unusual time just before the stroke of noon he begin to grow restless the attendant know the symptom and at once summon aid fortunately the man come at a run and be just in time for at the stroke of noon he become so violent that it take all their strength to hold he in about five minute however he begin to get more and more quiet and finally sink into a sort of melancholy in which state he have remain up to now the attendant tell i that his scream whilst in the paroxysm be really appalling i find my hand full when i get in attend to some of the other patient who be frighten by he indeed i can quite understand the effect for the sound disturb even i though i be some distance away it be now after the dinner hour of the asylum and as yet my patient sit in a corner brooding with a dull sullen woe begone look in his face which seem rather to indicate than to show something directly i can not quite understand it change in my patient at five i look in on he and find he seemingly as happy and content as he use to be he be catch fly and eat they and be keep note of his capture by make nail mark on the edge of the door between the ridge of padding when he see i he come over and apologise for his bad conduct and ask i in a very humble cringe way to be let back to his own room and to have his note book again i think it well to humour he so he be back in his room with the window open he have the sugar of his tea spread out on the windowsill and be reap quite a harvest of fly he be not now eat they but put they in a box as of old and be already examine the corner of his room to find a spider i try to get he to talk about the past few day for any clue of his thought would be of immense help to i but he would not rise for a moment or two he look very sad and say in a sort of far away voice as though say it rather to himself than to all over all over he have desert i no hope for i now unless i do it for myself then suddenly turn to i in a resolute way he say doctor will you be very good to i and let i have a little more sugar i think it would be good for i and the fly i say yes the fly like it too and i like the fly therefore i like it and there be people who know so little as to think that madman do not argue i procure he a double supply and leave he as happy a man as i suppose any in the world i wish i could fathom his mind change in he i have be to see miss westenra whom i find much well and have just return and be stand at our own gate look at the sunset when once more i hear he yell as his room be on this side of the house i could hear it well than in the morning it be a shock to i to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over london with its lurid light and inky shadow and all the marvellous tint that come on foul cloud even as on foul water and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building with its wealth of breathe misery and my own desolate heart to endure it all i reach he just as the sun be go down and from his window see the red disc sink as it sink he become less and less frenzied and just as it dip he slide from the hand that hold he an inert mass on the floor it be wonderful however what intellectual recuperative power lunatic have for within a few minute he stand up quite calmly and look around he i signal to the attendant not to hold he for i be anxious to see what he would do he go straight over to the window and brush out the crumb of sugar then he take his fly box and empty it outside and throw away the box then he shut the window and cross over sit down on his bed all this surprise i so i ask he be you not go to keep fly any more no say he i be sick of all that rubbish he certainly be a wonderfully interesting study i wish i could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion stop there may be a clue after all if we can find why to day his paroxysm come on at high noon and at sunset can it be that there be a malign influence of the sun at period which affect certain nature as at time the moon do other we shall see telegram seward london to van helsing amsterdam still well to day telegram seward london to van helsing amsterdam greatly improve good appetite sleep naturally good spirit colour come back telegram seward london to van helsing amsterdam change for the bad come at once do not lose an hour i hold over telegram to holmwood till have see you,5904

westenra be naturally anxious concern lucy and have consult i professionally about she i take advantage of the opportunity and tell she that my old master van helsing the great specialist be come to stay with i and that i would put she in his charge conjointly with myself so now we can come and go without alarm she unduly for a shock to she would mean sudden death and this in lucy weak condition might be disastrous to she we be hedge in with difficulty all of we my poor old fellow but please god we shall come through they all right if any need i shall write so that if you do not hear from i take it for grant that i be simply wait for news in haste your ever seward diary first thing van helsing say to i when we meet at liverpool street have you say anything to our young friend the lover of she no i say i wait till i have see you as i say in my telegram i write he a letter simply tell he that you be come as miss westenra be not so well and that i should let he know if need be right my friend he say quite right well he not know as yet perhaps he shall never know i pray so but if it be need then he shall know all and my good friend john let i caution you you deal with the madman all man be mad in some way or the other and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madman so deal with god madman too the rest of the world you tell not your madman what you do nor why you do it you tell they not what you think so you shall keep knowledge in its place where it may rest where it may gather its kind around it and breed you and i shall keep as yet what we know here and here he touch i on the heart and on the forehead and then touch himself the same way i have for myself thought at the present later i shall unfold to you why not now i ask it may do some good we may arrive at some decision he stop and look at i and my friend john when the corn be grow even before it have ripen while the milk of its mother earth be in he and the sunshine have not yet begin to paint he with his gold the husbandman he pull the ear and rub he between his rough hand and blow away the green chaff and say to you look he good corn he will make good crop when the time come i do not see the application and tell he so for reply he reach over and take my ear in his hand and pull it playfully as he use long ago to do at lecture and say the good husbandman tell you so then because he know but not till then but you do not find the good husbandman dig up his plant corn to see if he grow that be for the child who play at husbandry and not for those who take it as of the work of their life see you now friend john i have sow my corn and nature have her work to do in make it sprout if he sprout at all there some promise and i wait till the ear begin to swell he break off for he evidently see that i understand then he go on and very you be always a careful student and your case book be ever more full than the rest you be only student then now you be master and i trust that good habit have not fail remember my friend that knowledge be strong than memory and we should not trust the weak even if you have not keep the good practice let i tell you that this case of our dear miss be one that may be mind i say may such interest to we and other that all the rest may not make he kick the beam as your people say take then good note of it nothing be too small i counsel you put down in record even your doubt and surmise hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess we learn from failure not from success when i describe lucy symptom the same as before but definitely more marked he look very grave but say nothing he take with he a bag in which be many instrument and drug the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade as he once call in one of his lecture the equipment of a professor of the heal craft when we be show in westenra meet we she be alarmed but not nearly so much as i expect to find she nature in one of her beneficent mood have ordain that even death have some antidote to its own terror here in a case where any shock may prove fatal matter be so order that from some cause or other the thing not personal even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she be so attached do not seem to reach she it be something like the way dame nature gather round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact if this be an order selfishness then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism for there may be deep root for its cause than we have knowledge of i use my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology and lay down a rule that she should not be present with lucy or think of her illness more than be absolutely require she assent readily so readily that i see again the hand of nature fight for life van helsing and i be show up to lucy room if i be shock when i see she yesterday i be horrify when i see she to day she be ghastly chalkily pale the red seem to have go even from her lip and gum and the bone of her face stand out prominently her breathing be painful to see or hear van helsing face grow set as marble and his eyebrow converge till they almost touch over his nose lucy lie motionless and do not seem to have strength to speak so for a while we be all silent then van helsing beckon to i and we go gently out of the room the instant we have close the door he step quickly along the passage to the next door which be open then he pull i quickly in with he and close the door my god he say this be dreadful there be no time to be lose she will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart action as it should be there must be transfusion of blood at once be it you or i i be young and strong

open the door and arthur be step quickly in he rush up to i say in an eager jack i be so anxious i read between the line of your letter and have be in an agony the dad be well so i run down here to see for myself be not that gentleman van helsing i be so thankful to you sir for come when first the professor eye have light upon he he have be angry at any interruption at such a time but now as he

be the lover of our dear miss she be bad very very bad nay my child do not go like that for he suddenly grow pale and sit down in a chair almost faint you be to help she you can do more than any that live and your courage be your good help what can i do ask arthur hoarsely tell i and i shall do it my life be her and i would give the last drop of blood in my body for she the professor have a strongly humorous side and i could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his my young sir i do not ask so much as that not the last what shall i do there be fire in his eye and his open nostril quiver with intent van helsing slap he on the shoulder come he say you be a man and it be a man we want you be well than i well than my friend john arthur look bewildered and the professor go

transfer from full vein of one to the empty vein which pine for he john be to give his blood as he be the more young and strong than arthur take my hand and wrung it hard in now you be here you be more good than we old or young who toil much in the world of thought our nerve be not so calm and our blood not so bright than your arthur turn to he and if you only know how gladly i would die for she you would he stop with a sort of choke in his voice good boy say van helsing in the not so far off you will be happy that you have do all for she you love come now and be silent you shall kiss she once before it be do but then you must go and you must leave at my sign say no word to madame you know how it be with she there must be no shock any knowledge of this would be one come we all go up to

child see i lift you so that to swallow be easy yes she have make the effort with success it astonish i how long the drug take to act this in fact mark the extent of her weakness the time seem endless until sleep begin to flicker in her eyelid at last however the narcotic begin to manifest its potency and she fall into a deep sleep when the professor be satisfied he call arthur into the room and bid he strip off his coat then he add you may take that one little kiss while i bring over the table friend john help to i so neither of we look whilst he bend over she van helsing turn to i he be so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it then with swiftness but with absolute method van helsing perform the operation as the transfusion go on something like life seem

be it give i an idea of what a terrible strain lucy system must have undergo that what weaken arthur only partially restore she but the professor face be set and he stand watch in hand and with his eye fix now on the patient and now on arthur i could hear my own heart beat presently he say in a soft voice do not stir an instant it be enough you attend he i will look to she when all be over i could see how much arthur be weaken i dress the wound and take his arm to bring he away when van helsing speak without turn round the man seem to have eye in the back of his the brave lover i think deserve another kiss which he shall have presently and as he have now finish his operation he adjust the pillow to the patient head as he do so the narrow black velvet band which she seem always to wear round her throat buckle with an old diamond buckle which her lover have give she be drag a little up and show a red mark on her throat arthur do not notice it but i could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which be one of van helsing way of betray emotion he say nothing at the moment but turn to i say now take down our brave young lover give he of the port wine and let he lie down a while

disturb her peace of mind in the early morning her maid come and i leave she in her care and take myself back home for i be anxious about many thing i send a short wire to van helsing and to arthur tell they of the excellent result of the operation my own work with its manifold arrear take i all day to clear off it be dark when i be able to inquire about my zoophagous patient the report be good he have be quite quiet for the past day and night a telegram come from van helsing at amsterdam whilst i be at dinner suggest that i should be at hillingham to night as it might be well to be at hand and state that he be leave by the night mail and would join i early in the morning be pretty tired and wear out when i get to hillingham for two night i have hardly have a wink of sleep and my brain

stay here i shall leave this door open and my door too you can lie on the sofa for i know that nothing would induce any of you doctor to go to bed whilst there be a patient above the horizon if i want anything i shall call out and you can come to i at once i could not but acquiesce for i be dog tired and could not have sit up have i try so on she renew her promise to call i if she should want anything i lay on the sofa and forget all about everything lucy westenra diary feel so happy to night i have be so miserably weak that to be able to think and move about be like feel sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky somehow arthur feel very very close to i i seem to feel his presence warm about i i suppose it be that sickness and weakness be selfish thing and turn our inner eye and sympathy on ourselves whilst health and strength give love rein and in thought and feel he can wander where he will i know where my thought be if arthur only know my dear my dear your ear must tingle as you sleep as mine do wake oh the blissful rest of last night how i sleep with that dear good seward watch i and to night i shall not fear to sleep since he be close at hand and within call thank everybody for be so good to i thank god good night arthur seward diary be conscious of the professor hand on my head and start awake all in a second that be one of the thing that we learn in an asylum at any rate and how be our patient well when i leave she or rather when she leave i i answer come let we see he say and together we go into the room the blind be down and i go over to raise it gently whilst van helsing step with his soft cat like tread over to the bed as i raise the blind and the morning sunlight flood the room i hear the professor low hiss of inspiration and know its rarity a deadly fear shoot through my heart as i pass over he move back and his exclamation of horror gott in himmel need no enforcement from his agonised face he raise his hand and point to the bed and his iron face be draw and ashen white i feel my knee begin to tremble there on the bed seemingly in a swoon lie poor lucy more horribly white and wan look than ever even the lip be white and the gum seem to have shrink back from the tooth as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness van helsing raise his foot to stamp in anger but the instinct of his life and all the long year of habit stand to he and he put it down again softly quick he say bring the brandy i fly to the dining room and return with the decanter he wet the poor white lip with it and together we rub palm and wrist and heart he feel her heart and after a few moment of agonising suspense it be not too late it beat though but feebly all our work be undo we must begin again there be no young arthur here now i have to call on you yourself this time friend john as he speak he be dip into his bag and produce the instrument for transfusion i have take off my coat and roll up my shirt sleeve there be no possibility of an opiate just at present and no need of one and so without a moment delay we begin the operation after a time it do not seem a short time either for the draining away of one blood no matter how willingly it be give be a terrible feeling van helsing hold up a warning finger do not stir he say but i fear that with grow strength she may wake and that would make danger oh so much danger but i shall precaution take i shall give hypodermic injection of morphia he proceed then swiftly and deftly to carry out his intent the effect on lucy be not bad for the faint seem to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep it be with a feeling of personal pride that i could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheek and lip no man know till he experience it what it be to feel his own life blood draw away into the vein of the woman he love the professor watch i critically that will do he say already i remonstrate you take a great deal more from art to which he smile a sad sort of smile as he he be her lover she fiancé you have work much work to do for she and for other and the present will suffice when we stop the operation he attend to lucy whilst i apply digital pressure to my own incision i lie down whilst i wait his leisure to attend to i for i feel faint and a little sick by and by he bind up my wound and send i downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself as i be leave the room he come after i and half mind nothing must be say of this if our young lover should turn up unexpected as before no word to he it would at once frighten he and enjealous he too there must be none so when i come back he look at i carefully and then you be not much the bad go into the room and lie on your sofa and rest awhile then have much breakfast and come here to i i follow out his order for i know how right and wise they be i have do my part and now my next duty be to keep up my strength i feel very weak and in the weakness lose something of the amazement at what have occur i fall asleep on the sofa however wonder over and over again how lucy have make such a retrograde movement and how she could have be drain of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it i think i must have continue my wonder in my dream for sleep and wake my thought always come back to the little puncture in her throat and the ragged exhausted appearance of their edge tiny though they be lucy sleep well into the day and when she wake she be fairly well and strong though not nearly so much as the day before when van helsing have see she he go out for a walk leave i in charge with strict injunction that i be not to leave she for a moment i could hear his voice in the hall ask the way to the near telegraph office lucy chat with i freely and seem quite unconscious that anything have happen i try to keep she amuse and interested when her mother come up to see she she do not seem to notice any change whatever but say to i we owe you so much seward for all you have do but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself you be look pale yourself you want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit that you do as she speak lucy turn crimson though it be only momentarily for her poor waste vein could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head the reaction come in excessive pallor as she turn implore eye on i i smile and nod and lay my finger on my lip with a sigh she sink back amid her pillow van helsing return in a couple of hour and presently say to i now you go home and eat much and drink enough make yourself strong i stay here to night and i shall sit up with little miss myself you and i must watch the case and we must have none other to know i have grave reason no do not ask they think what you will do not fear to think even the most not probable good night in the hall two of the maid come to i and ask if they or either of they might not sit up with miss lucy they implore i to let they and when i say it be van helsing wish that either he or i should sit up they ask i quite piteously to intercede with the foreign gentleman i be much touch by their kindness perhaps it be because i be weak at present and perhaps it be on lucy account that their devotion be manifest for over and over again have i see similar instance of woman kindness i get back here in time for a late dinner go my round all well and set this down whilst wait for sleep it be come afternoon i go over to hillingham find van helsing in excellent spirit and lucy much well shortly after i have arrive a big parcel from abroad come for the professor he open it with much impressment assume of course and show a great bundle of white flower these be for you miss lucy he say for i oh van helsing yes my dear but not for you to play with these be medicine here lucy make a wry face nay but they be not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form so you need not snub that so charming nose or i shall point out to my friend arthur what woe he may have to endure in see so much beauty that he so love so much distort aha my pretty miss that bring the so nice nose all straight again this be medicinal but you do not know how i put he in your window i make pretty wreath and hang he round your neck so that you sleep well oh yes they like the lotus flower make your trouble forget it smell so like the water of lethe and of that fountain of youth that the conquistadores seek for in the floridas and find he all too late whilst he be speak lucy have be examine the flower and smell they now she throw they down say with half laughter and half oh professor i believe you be only put up a joke on i why these flower be only common garlic to my surprise van helsing rise up and say with all his sternness his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrow no trifling with i i never jest there be grim purpose in all i do and i warn you that you do not thwart i take care for the sake of other if not for your own then see poor lucy scar as she might well be he go on more gently oh little miss my dear do not fear i i only do for your good but there be much virtue to you in those so common flower see i place they myself in your room i make myself the wreath that you be to wear but hush no telling to other that make so inquisitive question we must obey and silence be a part of obedience and obedience be to bring you strong and well into love arm that wait for you now sit still awhile come with i friend john and you shall help i deck the room with my garlic which be all the way from haarlem where my friend vanderpool raise herb in his glass house all the year i have to telegraph yesterday or they would not have be here we go into the room take the flower with we the professor action be certainly odd and not to be find in any pharmacopœia that i ever hear of first he fasten up the window and latch they securely next take a handful of the flower he rub they all over the sash as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell then with the wisp he rub all over the jamb of the door above below and at each side and round the fireplace in the same way it all seem grotesque to i and presently i well professor i know you always have a reason for what you do but this certainly puzzle i it be well we have no sceptic here or he would say that you be work some spell to keep out an evil spirit perhaps i be he answer quietly as he begin to make the wreath which lucy be to wear round her neck we then wait whilst lucy make her toilet for the night and when she be in bed he come and himself fix the wreath of garlic round her neck the last word he say to her take care you do not disturb it and even if the room feel close do not to night open the window or the door i promise say lucy and thank you both a thousand time for all your kindness to i oh what have i do to be bless with such friend as we leave the house in my fly which be wait van helsing to night i can sleep in peace and sleep i want two night of travel much reading in the day between and much anxiety on the day to follow and a night to sit up without to wink to morrow in the morning early you call for i and we come together to see our pretty miss so much more strong for my spell which i have work ho ho he seem so confident that i remember my own confidence two night before and with the baneful result feel awe and vague terror it must have be my weakness that make i hesitate to tell it to my friend but i feel it all the more like unshed tear,5929

have be right for i feel comfort from they already somehow i do not dread be alone tonight and i can go to sleep without fear i shall not mind any flap outside the window oh the terrible struggle that

the carriage order from the hotel be wait the professor take his bag which he always bring with he now let all be put down exactly van helsing and i arrive at hillingham at eight it be a lovely morning the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seem like the completion of nature annual work the leaf be turn to all kind of beautiful colour but have not yet begin to drop from the tree when we enter we meet westenra come out of the morning room she be always an early riser she greet we warmly and you will be glad to know that lucy be well the dear child be still asleep i look into her room and see she but do not go in lest i should disturb she the professor smile and look quite jubilant he rub his hand together and aha i think i have diagnose the case my treatment be work to which she you must not take all the credit to yourself doctor lucy state this morning be due in part to i how do you mean ask the professor well i be anxious about the dear child in the night and go into her room she be sleep soundly so soundly that even my coming do not wake she but the room be awfully stuffy there be a lot of those horrible strong smell flower about everywhere and she have actually a bunch of they round her neck i fear that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state so i take they all away and open a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air you will be pleased with she i be sure she move off into her boudoir where she usually breakfast early as she have speak i watch the professor face and see it turn ashen grey he have be able to retain his self command whilst the poor lady be present for he know her state and how mischievous a shock would be he actually smile on she as he hold open the door for she to pass into her room but the instant she have disappear he pull i suddenly and forcibly into the dining room and close the door then for the first time in my life i see van helsing break down he raise his hand over his head in a sort of mute despair and then beat his palm together in a helpless way finally he sit down on a chair and put his hand before his face begin to sob with loud dry sob that seem to come from the very racking of his heart then he raise his arm again as though appeal to the whole universe god god god he say what have we do what have this poor thing do that we be so sore beset be there fate amongst we still send down from the pagan world of old that such thing must be and in such a way this poor mother all unknowing and all for the good as she think do such thing as lose her daughter body and soul and we must not tell she we must not even warn she or she die and then both die oh how we be beset how be all the power of the devil against we suddenly he jump to his foot come he say come we must see and act devil or no devil or all the devil at once it matter not we fight he all the same he go to the hall door for his bag and together we go up to lucy room once again i draw up the blind whilst van helsing go towards the bed this time he do not start as he look on the poor face with the same awful waxen pallor as before he wear a look of stern sadness and infinite pity as i expect he murmur with that hiss inspiration of his which mean so much without a word he go and lock the door and then begin to set out on the little table the instrument for yet another operation of transfusion of blood i have long ago recognise the necessity and begin to take off my coat but he stop i with a warn hand no he say to day you must operate i shall provide you be weaken already as he speak he take off his coat and roll up his shirt sleeve again the operation again the narcotic again some return of colour to the ashy cheek and the regular breathing of healthy sleep this time i watch whilst van helsing recruit himself and rest presently he take an opportunity of tell westenra that she must not remove anything from lucy room without consult he that the flower be of medicinal value and that the breathing of their odour be a part of the system of cure then he take over the care of the case himself say that he would watch this night and the next and would send i word when to come after another hour lucy wake from her sleep fresh and bright and seemingly not much the bad from her terrible ordeal what do it all mean i be begin to wonder if my long habit of life amongst the insane be begin to tell upon my own brain lucy westenra diary day and night of peace i be get so strong again that i hardly know myself it be as if i have pass through some long nightmare and have just awaken to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around i i have a dim half remembrance of long anxious time of wait and fear darkness in which there be not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant and then long spell of oblivion and the rise back to life as a diver come up through a great press of water since however van helsing have be with i all this bad dreaming seem to have pass away the noise that use to frighten i out of my wit the flapping against the window the distant voice which seem so close to i the harsh sound that come from i know not where and command i to do i know not what have all cease i go to bed now without any fear of sleep i do not even try to keep awake i have grow quite fond of the garlic and a boxful arrive for i every day from haarlem to night van helsing be go away as he have to be for a day in amsterdam but i need not be watch i be well enough to be leave alone thank god for mother sake and dear arthur and for all our friend who have be so kind i shall not even feel the change for last night van helsing sleep in his chair a lot of the time i find he asleep twice when i awake but i do not fear to go to sleep again although the bough or bat or something flap almost angrily against the window pane the pall mall gazette september the escaped wolf adventure of our interview with the keeper in the zoological gardens after many inquiry and almost as many refusal and perpetually use the word pall mall gazette as a sort of talisman i manage to find the keeper of the section of the zoological gardens in which the wolf department be include thomas bilder live in one of the cottage in the enclosure behind the elephant house and be just sit down to his tea when i find he thomas and his wife be hospitable folk elderly and without child and if the speciman i enjoy of their hospitality be of the average kind their life must be pretty comfortable the keeper would not enter on what he call business until the supper be over and we be all satisfied then when the table be clear and he have light his pipe he now sir you can go on and arsk i what you want you excoose i refoosin to talk of perfeshunal subject afore meal i give the wolf and the jackal and the hyena in all our section their tea afore i begin to arsk they question how do you mean ask they question i query wishful

usin of obscene language that be itten i over the ead but the arf quid make that all right i be a to fight so i wait for the food and do with my owl as the wolf and lion and tiger do but lor love yer art now that the old ooman have stick a chunk of her tea cake in i an rinse i out with her bloomin old teapot and i light up you may scratch my ear for all you worth and will get even a growl out of i drive along with your question i know what yer a comin at that ere escape wolf exactly i want you to give i your view of it just tell i how it happen and when i know the fact i get you to say what you consider be the cause of it and how you think the whole affair will end all right this ere be about the ole story that ere wolf what we call bersicker be one of three grey one that come from norway to jamrach which we buy off he four year ago he be a nice well behave wolf that never give no trouble to talk of i more surprised at i m for wantin to get out nor any other animile in the place but there you can trust wolf no more nor woman do you mind he sir break in tom with a cheery laugh e get mindin the animile so long that bl if he ai like a old wolf isself but there ai no arm in i well sir it be about two hour after feedin yesterday when i first hear any disturbance i be makin up a litter in the monkey house for a young puma which be ill but when i hear the yelpin and owlin i kem away straight there be bersicker a tearin like a mad thing at the bar as if he want to get out there be much people about that day and close at hand be only one man a tall thin chap with a ook nose and a pointed beard with a few white hair runnin through it he have a ard cold look and red eye and i take a sort of mislike to he for it seem as if it be i m as they be hirritate at he ad white kid glove on be and and he point out the animile to i and say keeper these wolf seem upset at something maybe it you say i for i do not like the air as he give isself he do get angry as i ope he would but he smile a kind of insolent smile with a mouth full of white sharp tooth oh no they would like i e say ow yes they would say i a imitatin of he they always like a bone or two to clean their tooth on about tea time which you as a bagful well it be a odd thing but when the animile see we a talkin they lie down and when i go over to bersicker he let i stroke his ear same as ever that there man kem over and bless but if he do put in his hand and stroke the old wolf ear too tyke care say bersicker be quick never mind he say i use to be you in the business yourself i say tyke off my at for a man what trade in wolf anceterer be a good friend to keeper no say he not exactly in the business but i ave make pet of several and with that he lift his at as perlite as a lord and walk away old bersicker kep a lookin arter i m till e be out of sight and then go and lie down in a corner and would come hout the ole hevening well larst night so soon as the moon be hup the wolf here all begin there nothing for they to owl at there no one near except some one that be evidently a callin a dog somewhere out back of the garding in the park road once or twice i go out to see that all be right and it be and then the owling stop just before twelve i just take a look round afore turnin in an bust i but when i kem opposite to old bersicker cage i see the rail break and twist about and the cage empty and that all i know for certe do any one else see anything one of our be a comin ome about that time from a armony when he see a big grey dog comin out through the gardin edge at least so he say but i do give much for it myself for if he do e never say a word about it to his missis when e get ome and it be only after the escape of the wolf be make known and we have be up all night a huntin of the park for bersicker that he remember seein anything my own belief be that the armony ad get into his ead now bilder can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf well sir he say with a suspicious sort of modesty i think i can but i do know as ow you be satisfied with the theory certainly i shall if a man like you who know the animal from experience can hazard a good guess at any rate who be even to try well then sir i account for it this way it seem to i that ere wolf escape simply because he want to get out from the hearty way that both thomas and his wife laugh at the joke i could see that it have do service before and that the whole explanation be simply an elaborate sell i could cope in badinage with the worthy thomas but i think i know a surer way to his heart so i now bilder we consider that first half sovereign work off and this brother of his be wait to be claim when you tell i what you think will happen right sir he say briskly excoose i i know for a chaffin of ye but the old woman here wink at i which be as much as tell i to go on well i never say the old lady my opinion be this that ere wolf be of somewhere the wot do remember say he be a gallopin northward fast than a horse could go but i do believe he for yer see sir wolf do gallop no more than dog do they not bein build that way wolf be fine thing in a story book and i dessay when they get in pack and do be chivvin that more afeared than they be they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up whatever it be but lor bless you in real life a wolf be only a low creature not half so clever as a good dog and not half a quarter so much fight in i this one ai be use to fightin or even to providin for hisself and more like he somewhere round the park an a shiverin of and if he think at all wonderin where he be to get his breakfast from or maybe he get down some area and be in a coal cellar my eye will some cook get a rum start when she see his green eye a shin at she out of the dark if he can get food he bind to look for it and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher shop in time if he do and some nursemaid go a walkin orf with a soldier leavin of the hinfant in the perambulator well then i should be surprised if the census be one babby the less that all i be hand he the half sovereign when something come bob up against the window and bilder face double its natural length with surprise god bless i he say if there ai old bersicker come back by isself he go to the door and open it a most unnecessary proceeding it seem to i i have always think that a wild animal never look so well as when some obstacle of pronounce durability be between we a personal experience have intensify rather than diminish that idea after all however there be nothing like custom for neither bilder nor his wife think any more of the wolf than i should of a dog the animal itself be as peaceful and well behave as that father of all picture wolf red riding hood quondam friend whilst seek her confidence in masquerade the whole scene be an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos the wicked wolf that for half a day have paralyse london and set all the child in the town shiver in their shoe be there in a sort of penitent mood and be receive and pet like a sort of vulpine prodigal son old bilder examine he all over with most tender solicitude and when he have finish with his penitent there i know the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble do i say it all along here his head all cut and full of broken glass e be a gettin over some bloomin wall or other it a shyme that people be allow to top their wall with broken bottle this ere what come of it come along bersicker he take the wolf and lock he up in a cage with a piece of meat that satisfy in quantity at any rate the elementary condition of the fat calf and go off to report i come off too to report the only exclusive information that be give to day regard the strange escapade at the zoo seward diary be engage after dinner in my study post up my book which through press of other work and the many visit to lucy have fall sadly into arrear suddenly the door be burst open and in rush my patient with his face

a dinner knife in his hand and as i see he be dangerous i try to keep the table between we he be too quick and too strong for i however for before i could get my balance he have strike at i and cut my left wrist rather severely before he could strike again however i get in my right and he be sprawl on his back on the floor my wrist bleed freely and quite a little pool trickle on to the carpet i see

at the window which have begin after the sleep walk on the cliff at whitby when mina save i and which now i know so well i be not afraid but i do wish that seward be in the next room as van helsing say he would be so that i might have call he i try to go to sleep but could not then there come to i the old fear of sleep and i determine to keep awake perversely sleep would try to come when i do not want it so as i fear to be alone i open my door and call out be there anybody there there be no answer i be afraid to wake mother and so close my door again then outside in the shrubbery i hear a sort of howl like a dog but more fierce and deep i go to the window and look out but could see nothing except a big bat which have evidently be buffet its wing against the window so i go back to bed again but determine not to go to sleep presently the door open and mother look in see by my moving that i be not asleep come in and sit by i she say to i even more sweetly and softly than her i be uneasy about you darling and come in to see that you be all right i fear she might catch cold sit there and ask she to come in and sleep with i so she come into bed and lie down beside i she do not take off her dressing gown for she say she would only stay awhile and then go back to her own bed as she lie there in my arm and i in her the flap and buffeting come to the window again she be startled and a little frightened and cry out what be that i try to pacify she and at last succeed and she lie quiet but i could hear her poor dear heart still beat terribly after a while there be the low howl again out in the shrubbery and shortly after there be a crash at the window and a lot of broken glass be hurl on the floor the window blind blow back with the wind that rush in and in the aperture of the broken pane there be the head of a great gaunt grey wolf mother cry out in a fright and struggle up into a sit posture and clutch wildly at anything that would help she amongst other thing she clutch the wreath of flower that van helsing insist on my wear round my neck and tear it away from i for a second or two she sit up point at the wolf and there be a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat then she fall over as if strike with lightning and her head hit my forehead and make i dizzy for a moment or two the room and all round seem to spin round i keep my eye fix on the window but the wolf draw his head back and a whole myriad of little speck seem to come blow in through the broken window and wheel and circle round like the pillar of dust that traveller describe when there be a simoom in the desert i try to stir but there be some spell upon i and dear mother poor body which seem to grow cold already for her dear heart have cease to beat weigh i down and i remember no more for a while the time do not seem long but very very awful till i recover consciousness again somewhere near a pass bell be tolling the dog all round the neighbourhood be howl and in our shrubbery seemingly just outside a nightingale be sing i be daze and stupid with pain and terror and weakness but the sound of the nightingale seem like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort i the sound seem to have awaken the maid too for i could hear their bare foot patter outside my door i call to they and they come in and when they see what have happen and what it be that lie over i in the bed they scream out the wind rush in through the broken window and the door slam to they lift off the body of my dear mother and lay she cover up with a sheet on the bed after i have get up they be all so frightened and nervous that i direct they to go to the dining room and have each a glass of wine the door fly open for an instant and close again the maid shriek and then go in a body to the dining room and i lay what flower i have on my dear mother breast when they be there i remember what van helsing have tell i but i do like to remove they and besides i would have some of the servant to sit up with i now i be surprised that the maid do not come back i call they but get no answer so i go to the dining room to look for they my heart sink when i see what have happen they

and look on the sideboard i find that the bottle which mother doctor use for she oh do use be empty what be i to do what be i to do i be back in the room with mother i can not leave she and i be alone save for the sleep servant whom some one have drug alone with the dead i dare not go out for i can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window the air seem full of speck float and circle

12,CHAPTER 12,chapter xii seward drive at once to hillingham and arrive early keep my cab at the gate i go up the avenue alone i knock gently and ring as quietly as possible for i fear to disturb lucy or her mother and hop to bring only a servant to the door after a while find no response i knock and rang again still no answer i curse the laziness of the servant that they should lie abe at such an hour for it be now ten and so rang and knock again but more impatiently and still without response hitherto i have blame only the servant but now a terrible fear begin to assail i be this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seem draw tight around we be it indeed a house of death to which i have come too late i know that minute even second of delay might mean hour of danger to lucy if she have have again one of those frightful relapse and i go round the house to try if i could to find by chance an entry anywhere i could find no mean of ingress every window and door be fasten and lock and i return baffle to the porch as i do so i hear the rapid pit pat of a swiftly drive horse foot they stop at the gate and a few second later i meet van helsing run up the avenue when he see i he gasp then it be you and just arrive how be she be we too late do you not get my telegram i answer as quickly and coherently as i could that i have only get his telegram early in the morning and have not lose a minute in come here and that i could not make any one in the house hear i he pause and raise his hat as he say then i fear we be too late god will be do with his usual recuperative energy he go on come if there be no way open to get in we must make one time be all in all to we now we go round to the back of the house where there be a kitchen window the professor take a small surgical saw from his case and hand it to i point to the iron bar which guard the window i attack they at once and have very soon cut through three of they then with a long thin knife we push back the fastening of the sash and open the window i help the professor in and follow he there be no one in the kitchen or in the servant room which be close at hand we try all the room as we go along and in the dining room dimly light by ray of light through the shutter find four servant woman lie on the floor there be no need to think they dead for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room leave no doubt as to their condition van helsing and i look at each other and as we move away he say we can attend to they later then we ascend to lucy room for an instant or two we pause at the door to listen but there be no sound that we could hear with white face and tremble hand we open the door gently and enter the room how shall i describe what we see on the bed lie two woman lucy and her mother the latter lie farth in and she be cover with a white sheet the edge of which have be blow back by the draught through the broken window show the draw white face with a look of terror fix upon it by her side lie lucy with face white and still more drawn the flower which have be round her neck we find upon her mother bosom and her throat be bare show the two little wound which we have notice before but look horribly white and mangle without a word the professor bend over the bed his head almost touch poor lucy breast then he give a quick turn of his head as of one who listen and leap to his foot he cry out to it be not yet too late quick quick bring the brandy i fly downstairs and return with it take care to smell and taste it lest it too be drug like the decanter of sherry which i find on the table the maid be still breathe but more restlessly and i fancy that the narcotic be wear off i do not stay to make sure but return to van helsing he rub the brandy as on another occasion on her lip and gum and on her wrist and the palm of her hand he say to i can do this all that can be at the present you go wake those maid flick they in the face with a wet towel and flick they hard make they get heat and fire and a warm bath this poor soul be nearly as cold as that beside she she will need be heat before we can do anything more i go at once and find little difficulty in wake three of the woman the fourth be only a young girl and the drug have evidently affect she more strongly so i lift she on the sofa and let her sleep the other be daze at first but as remembrance come back to they they cry and sob in a hysterical manner i be stern with they however and would not let they talk i tell they that one life be bad enough to lose and that if they delay they would sacrifice miss lucy so sob and cry they go about their way half clothe as they be and prepare fire and water fortunately the kitchen and boiler fire be still alive and there be no lack of hot water we get a bath and carry lucy out as she be and place she in it whilst we be busy chafe her limb there be a knock on the hall door one of the maid run off hurry on some more clothe and open it then she return and whisper to we that there be a gentleman who have come with a message from holmwood i bid she simply tell he that he must wait for we could see no one now she go away with the message and engross with our work i clean forget all about he i never see in all my experience the professor work in such deadly earnest i know as he know that it be a stand up fight with death and in a pause tell he so he answer i in a way that i do not understand but with the stern look that his face could if that be all i would stop here where we be now and let she fade away into peace for i see no light in life over her horizon he go on with his work with if possible renew and more frenzied vigour presently we both begin to be conscious that the heat be begin to be of some effect lucy heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope and her lung have a perceptible movement van helsing face almost beam and as we lift she from the bath and roll she in a hot sheet to dry she he say to the first gain be ours check to the king we take lucy into another room which have by now be prepare and lay she in bed and force a few drop of brandy down her throat i notice that van helsing tie a soft silk handkerchief round her throat she be still unconscious and be quite as bad as if not bad than we have ever see she van helsing call in one of the woman and tell she to stay with she and not to take her eye off she till we return and then beckon i out of the room we must consult as to what be to be do he say as we descend the stair in the hall he open the dining room door and we pass in he close the door carefully behind he the shutter have be open but the blind be already down with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the british woman of the low class always rigidly observe the room be therefore dimly dark it be however light enough for our purpose van helsing sternness be somewhat relieve by a look of perplexity he be evidently torture his mind about something so i wait for an instant and he what be we to do now where be we to turn for help we must have another transfusion of blood and that soon or that poor girl life will be worth an hour purchase you be exhaust already i be exhaust too i fear to trust those woman even if they would have courage to submit what be we to do for some one who will open his vein for she what the matter with i anyhow the voice come from the sofa across the room and its tone bring relief and joy to my heart for they be those of quincey morris van helsing start angrily at the first sound but his face soften and a glad look come into his eye as i cry out quincey morris and rush towards he with outstretche hand what bring you here i cry as our hand meet i guess art be the cause he hand i a have not hear from seward for three day and be terribly anxious can not leave father still in same condition send i word how lucy be do not i think i come just in the nick of time you know you have only to tell i what to do van helsing strode forward and take his hand look he straight in the eye as he a brave man blood be the good thing on this earth when a woman be in trouble you a man and no mistake well the devil may work against we for all he worth but god send we man when we want they once again we go through that ghastly operation i have not the heart to go through with the detail lucy have get a terrible shock and it tell on she more than before for though plenty of blood go into her vein her body do not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasion her struggle back into life be something frightful to see and hear however the action of both heart and lung improve and van helsing make a subcutaneous injection of morphia as before and with good effect her faint become a profound slumber the professor watch whilst i go downstairs with quincey morris and send one of the maid to pay off one of the cabman who be wait i leave quincey lie down after have a glass of wine and tell the cook to get ready a good breakfast then a thought strike i and i go back to the room where lucy now be when i come softly in i find van helsing with a sheet or two of note paper in his hand he have evidently read it and be think it over as he sit with his hand to his brow there be a look of grim satisfaction in his face as of one who have have a doubt solve he hand i the paper say only it drop from lucy breast when we carry she to the bath when i have read it i stand look at the professor and after a pause ask he in god name what do it all mean be she or be she mad or what sort of horrible danger be it i be so bewildered that i do not know what to say more van helsing put out his hand and take the paper do not trouble about it now forget it for the present you shall know and understand it all in good time but it will be later and now what be that you come to i to say this bring i back to fact and i be all myself again i come to speak about the certificate of death if we do not act properly and wisely there may be an inquest and that paper would have to be produce i be in hope that we need have no inquest for if we have it would surely kill poor lucy if nothing else do i know and you know and the other doctor who attend her know that westenra have disease of the heart and we can certify that she die of it let we fill up the certificate at once and i shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker good oh my friend john well think of truly miss lucy if she be sad in the foe that beset she be at least happy in the friend that love she one two three all open their vein for she besides one old man ah yes i know friend john i be not blind i love you all the more for it now go in the hall i meet quincey morris with a telegram for arthur tell he that westenra be dead that lucy also have be ill but be now go on well and that van helsing and i be with she i tell he where i be go and he hurry i out but as i be go when you come back jack may i have two word with you all to ourselves i nod in reply and go out i find no difficulty about the registration and arrange with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangement when i get back quincey be wait for i i tell he i would see he as soon as i know about lucy and go up to her room she be still sleep and the professor seemingly have not move from his seat at her side from his put his finger to his lip i gather that he expect she to wake before long and be afraid of forestall nature so i go down to quincey and take he into the breakfast room where the blind be not draw down and which be a little more cheerful or rather less cheerless than the other room when we be alone he say to jack seward i do want to shove myself in anywhere where i no right to be but this be no ordinary case you know i love that girl and want to marry she but although that all past and go i can help feel anxious about she all the same what be it that wrong with she the dutchman and a fine old fellow he be i can see that say that time you two come into the room that you must have another transfusion of blood and that both you and he be exhaust now i know well that you medical man speak in camera and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private but this be no common matter and whatever it be i have do my part be not that so that so i say and he go i take it that both you and van helsing have do already what i do to day be not that so that so and i guess art be in it too when i see he four day ago down at his own place he look queer i have not see anything pull down so quick since i be on the pampas and have a mare that i be fond of go to grass all in a night one of those big bat that they call vampire have get at she in the night and what with his gorge and the vein leave open there be enough blood in she to let she stand up and i have to put a bullet through she as she lay jack if you may tell i without betray confidence arthur be the first be not that so as he speak the poor fellow look terribly anxious he be in a torture of suspense regard the woman he love and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seem to surround she intensify his pain his very heart be bleed and it take all the manhood of he and there be a royal lot of it too to keep he from break down i pause before answer for i feel that i must not betray anything which the professor wish keep secret but already he know so much and guess so much that there could be no reason for not answer so i answer in the same phrase that so and how long have this be go on about ten day ten day then i guess jack seward that that poor pretty creature that we all love have have put into her vein within that time the blood of four strong man man alive her whole body would hold it then come close to i he speak in a fierce half whisper what take it out i shake my head that i say be the crux van helsing be simply frantic about it and i be at my wit end i can even hazard a guess there have be a series of little circumstance which have throw out all our calculation as to lucy be properly watch but these shall not occur again here we stay until all be well or ill quincey hold out his hand count i in he say you and the dutchman will tell i what to do and i do it when she wake late in the afternoon lucy first movement be to feel in her breast and to my surprise produce the paper which van helsing have give i to read the careful professor have replace it where it have come from lest on wake she should be alarm her eye then light on van helsing and on i too and gladden then she look round the room and see where she be shudder she give a loud cry and put her poor thin hand before her pale face we both understand what that mean that she have realise to the full her mother death so we try what we could to comfort she doubtless sympathy ease she somewhat but she be very low in thought and spirit and weep silently and weakly for a long time we tell she that either or both of we would now remain with she all the time and that seem to comfort she towards dusk she fall into a doze here a very odd thing occur whilst still asleep she take the paper from her breast and tear it in two van helsing step over and take the piece from she all the same however she go on with the action of tearing as though the material be still in her hand finally she lift her hand and open they as though scatter the fragment van helsing seem surprised and his brow gather as if in thought but he say nothing last night she sleep fitfully be always afraid to sleep and something weak when she wake from it the professor and i take it in turn to watch and we never leave she for a moment unattended quincey morris say nothing about his intention but i know that all night long he patrol round and round the house when the day come its search light show the ravage in poor lucy strength she be hardly able to turn her head and the little nourishment which she could take seem to do she no good at time she sleep and both van helsing and i notice the difference in she between sleep and wake whilst asleep she look strong although more haggard and her breathing be soft her open mouth show the pale gum draw back from the tooth which thus look positively long and sharp than usual when she wake the softness of her eye evidently change the expression for she look her own self although a die one in the afternoon she ask for arthur and we telegraph for he quincey go off to meet he at the station when he arrive it be nearly six and the sun be set full and warm and the red light stream in through the window and give more colour to the pale cheek when he see she arthur be simply choke with emotion and none of we could speak in the hour that have pass the fit of sleep or the comatose condition that pass for it have grow more frequent so that the pause when conversation be possible be shorten arthur presence however seem to act as a stimulant she rally a little and speak to he more brightly than she have do since we arrive he too pull himself together and speak as cheerily as he could so that the good be make of everything it be now nearly one and he and van helsing be sit with she i be to relieve they in a quarter of an hour and i be enter this on lucy phonograph until six they be to try to rest i fear that

everything leave in my charge with regard to patient renfield there be more to say he have have another outbreak which might have have a dreadful ending but which as it fortunately happen be unattended with any unhappy result this afternoon a carrier cart with two man make a call at the empty house whose ground abut on our the house to which you will remember the patient twice run away the man stop at our gate to ask the porter their way as they be stranger i be myself look out of the study window have a smoke after dinner and see one of they come up to the house as he pass the window of renfield room the patient begin to rate he from within and call he all the foul name he could lay his tongue to the man who seem a decent fellow enough content himself by tell he to shut up for a foul mouthed beggar whereon our man accuse he of rob he and want to murder he and say that he would hinder he if he be to swing for it i open the window and sign to the man not to notice so he content himself after look the place over and make up his mind as to what kind of place he have get to by say lor bless yer sir i would mind what be say to i in a bloomin madhouse i pity ye and the for to live in the house with a wild beast like that then he ask the way civilly enough and i tell he where the gate of the empty house be he go away follow by threat and curse and reviling from our man i go down to see if i could make out any cause for his anger since he be usually such a well behave man and except his violent fit nothing of the kind have ever occur i find he to my astonishment quite composed and most genial in his manner i try to get he to talk of the incident but he blandly ask i question as to what i mean and lead i to believe that he be completely oblivious of the affair it be i be sorry to say however only another instance of his cunning for within half an hour i hear of he again this time he have break out through the window of his room and be run down the avenue i call to the attendant to follow i and run after he for i fear he be intent on some mischief my fear be justify when i see the same cart which have pass before come down the road have on it some great wooden box the man be wipe their forehead and be flush in the face as if with violent exercise before i could get up to he the patient rush at they and pull one of they off the cart begin to knock his head against the ground if i have not seize he just at the moment i believe he would have kill the man there and then the other fellow jump down and strike he over the head with the butt end of his heavy whip it be a terrible blow but he do not seem to mind it but seize he also and struggle with the three of we pull we to and fro as if we be kitten you know i be no light weight and the other be both burly man at first he be silent in his fighting but as we begin to master he and the attendant be put a strait waistcoat on he he begin to shout i frustrate they they shall rob i they shall murder i by inch i fight for my lord and master and all sort of similar incoherent raving it be with very considerable difficulty that they get he back to the house and put he in the padded room one of the attendant hardy have a finger break however i set it all right and he be go on well the two carrier be at first loud in their threat of action for damage and promise to rain all the penalty of the law on we their threat be however mingle with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of they by a feeble madman they say that if it have not be for the way their strength have be spend in carry and raise the heavy box to the cart they would have make short work of he they give as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they have be reduce by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labour of any place of public entertainment i quite understand their drift and after a stiff glass of grog or rather more of the same and with each a sovereign in hand they make light of the attack and swear that they would encounter a bad madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so bloomin good a bloke as your correspondent i take their name and address in case they might be need they be as smollet of dudding rents king george road great walworth and thomas snelling peter parley row guide court bethnal green they be both in the employment of harris sons moving and shipment company orange master yard soho i shall report to you any matter of interest occur here and shall wire you at once if there be anything of importance believe i dear sir your faithfully letter mina harker to lucy westenra unopened by she september my dear such a sad blow have befall we hawkins have die very suddenly some may not think it so sad for we but we have both come to so love he that it really seem as though we have lose a father i never know either father or mother so that the dear old man death be a real blow to i jonathan be greatly distressed it be not only that he feel sorrow deep sorrow for the dear good man who have befriend he all his life and now at the end have treat he like his own son and leave he a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up be wealth beyond the dream of avarice but jonathan feel it on another account he say the amount of responsibility which it put upon he make he nervous he begin to doubt himself i try to cheer he up and my belief in he help he to have a belief in himself but it be here that the grave shock that he experience tell upon he the most oh it be too hard that a sweet simple noble strong nature such as his a nature which enable he by our dear good friend aid to rise from clerk to master in a few year should be so injure that the very essence of its strength be go forgive i dear if i worry you with my trouble in the midst of your own happiness but lucy dear i must tell some one for the strain of keep up a brave and cheerful appearance to jonathan try i and i have no one here that i can confide in i dread come up to london as we must do the day after to morrow for poor hawkins leave in his will that he be to be bury in the grave with his father as there be no relation at all jonathan will have to be chief mourner i shall try to run over to see you dearest if only for a few minute forgive i for trouble you with all blessing your love seward diary resolution and habit can let i make an entry to night i be too miserable too low spirit too sick of the world and all in it include life itself and i would not care if i hear this moment the flapping of the wing of the angel of death and he have be flap those grim wing to some purpose of late lucy mother and arthur father and now let i get on with my work i duly relieve van helsing in his watch over lucy we want arthur to go to rest also but he refuse at first it be only when i tell he that we should want he to help we during the day and that we must not all break down for want of rest lest lucy should suffer that he agree to go van helsing be very kind to he come my child he say come with i you be sick and weak and have have much sorrow and much mental pain as well as that tax on your strength that we know of you must not be alone for to be alone be to be full of fear and alarm come to the drawing room where there be a big fire and there be two sofa you shall lie on one and i on the other and our sympathy will be comfort for each other even though we do not speak and even if we sleep arthur go off with he cast back a longing look on lucy face which lie on her pillow almost white than the lawn she lie quite still and i look round the room to see that all be as it should be i could see that the professor have carry out in this room as in the other his purpose of use the garlic the whole of the window sash reek with it and round lucy neck over the silk handkerchief which van helsing make she keep on be a rough chaplet of the same odorous flower lucy be breathe somewhat stertorously and her face be at its bad for the open mouth show the pale gum her tooth in the dim uncertain light seem long and sharp than they have be in the morning in particular by some trick of the light the canine tooth look long and sharp than the rest i sit down by she and presently she move uneasily at the same moment there come a sort of dull flap or buffet at the window i go over to it softly and peep out by the corner of the blind there be a full moonlight and i could see that the noise be make by a great bat which wheel round doubtless attract by the light although so dim and every now and again strike the window with its wing when i come back to my seat i find that lucy have move slightly and have tear away the garlic flower from her throat i replace they as well as i could and sit watch she presently she wake and i give her food as van helsing have prescribe she take but a little and that languidly there do not seem to be with she now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that have hitherto so mark her illness it strike i as curious that the moment she become conscious she press the garlic flower close to she it be certainly odd that whenever she get into that lethargic state with the stertorous breathing she put the flower from she but that when she wake she clutch they close there be no possibility of make any mistake about this for in the long hour that follow she have many spell of sleep and wake and repeat both action many time at six van helsing come to relieve i arthur have then fall into a doze and he mercifully let he sleep on when he see lucy face i could hear the hiss indraw of his breath and he say to i in a sharp whisper draw up the blind i want light then he bend down and with his face almost touch lucy examine she carefully he remove the flower and lift the silk handkerchief from her throat as he do so he start back and i could hear his ejaculation mein gott as it be smother in his throat i bent over and look too and as i notice some queer chill come over i the wound on the throat have absolutely disappear for fully five minute van helsing stand look at she with his face at its stern then he turn to i and say she be die it will not be long now it will be much difference mark i whether she die conscious or in her sleep wake that poor boy and let he come and see the last he trust we and we have promise he i go to the dining room and wake he he be daze for a moment but when he see the sunlight stream in through the edge of the shutter he think he be late and express his fear i assure he that lucy be still asleep but tell he as gently as i could that both van helsing and i fear that the end be near he cover his face with his hand and slide down on his knee by the sofa where he remain perhaps a minute with his hand bury pray whilst his shoulder shake with grief i take he by the hand and raise he up come i say my dear old fellow summon all your fortitude it will be good and easy for her when we come into lucy room i could see that van helsing have with his usual forethought be put matter straight and make everything look as pleasing as possible he have even brush lucy hair so that it lie on the pillow in its usual sunny ripple when we come into the room she open her eye and see he whisper arthur oh my love i be glad you have come he be stoop to kiss she when van helsing motion he back no he whisper not yet hold her hand it will comfort she more so arthur take her hand and kneel beside she and she look her good with all the soft line match the angelic beauty of her eye then gradually her eye close and she sink to sleep for a little bit her breast heave softly and her breath come and go like a tired child and then insensibly there come the strange change which i have notice in the night her breathing grow stertorous the mouth open and the pale gum draw back make the tooth look long and sharp than ever in a sort of sleep wake vague unconscious way she open her eye which be now dull and hard at once and say in a soft voluptuous voice such as i have never hear from her arthur oh my love i be so glad you have come kiss i arthur bend eagerly over to kiss she but at that instant van helsing who like i have be startle by her voice swoop upon he and catch he by the neck with both hand drag he back with a fury of strength which i never think he could have possess and actually hurl he almost across the room not for your life he say not for your living soul and her and he stand between they like a lion at bay arthur be so take aback that he do not for a moment know what to do or say and before any impulse of violence could seize he he realise the place and the occasion and he stand silent wait i keep my eye fix on lucy as do van helsing and we see a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face the sharp tooth champ together then her eye close and she breathe heavily very shortly after she open her eye in all their softness and put out her poor pale thin hand take van helsing great brown one draw it to she she kiss it my true friend she say in a faint voice but with untellable pathos my true friend and his oh guard he and give i peace i swear it say he solemnly kneel beside she and hold up his hand as one who register an oath then he turn to arthur and say to he come my child take her hand in your and kiss she on the forehead and only once their eye meet instead of their lip and so they part lucy eye close and van helsing who have be watch closely take arthur arm and draw he away and then lucy breathing become stertorous again and all at once it cease it be all over say van helsing she be dead i take arthur by the arm and lead he away to the drawing room where he sit down and cover his face with his hand sob in a way that nearly break i down to see i go back to the room and find van helsing look at poor lucy and his face be stern than ever some change have come over her body death have give back part of her beauty for her brow and cheek have recover some of their flow line even the lip have lose their deadly pallor it be as if the blood no long need for the working of the heart have go to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be we think she die whilst she sleep and sleep when she die i stand beside van helsing and ah well poor girl there be peace for she at last it be the end he turn to i and say with grave not so alas not so it be only the beginning when i ask he what he mean he only shake his head and we can do nothing as yet wait and see,7274

we be unable to notify any one who should have be bid under the circumstance van helsing and i take it upon ourselves to examine paper etc he insist upon look over lucy paper himself i ask he why for i fear that he be a foreigner might not be quite aware of english legal requirement and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble he answer i know i know you forget that i be a lawyer as

do his work well for the room be turn into a small chapelle ardente there be a wilderness of beautiful white flower and death be make as little repulsive as might be the end of the winding sheet be lay over the face when the professor bend over and turn it gently back we both start at the beauty before we the tall wax candle show a sufficient light to note it well all lucy loveliness have come back to she in death and the hour that have pass instead of leave trace of decay effacing finger have but restore the beauty of life till positively i could not believe my eye that i be look at a corpse the professor look sternly grave he have not love she as i have and there be no need for tear in his eye he say to i remain till i return and leave the room he come back with a handful of wild garlic from the box wait in the hall but which have not be open and place the flower amongst the other on and around the bed then he take from his neck inside his collar a little golden crucifix and

and then replace all so that none know save we alone but why do it at all the girl be dead why mutilate her poor body without need and if there be no necessity for a post mortem and nothing to gain by

heavy heart and feel oh so lonely when i want all help and courage that may be he pause a moment and go on solemnly friend john there be strange and terrible day before we let we not be two but one that so we work to a good end will you not have faith in i i take his hand and promise he i hold my door open as he go away and watch he go into his room and close the door as i stand without move i see one of the maid pass silently along the passage she have she back towards i so do not see i and go into the room where lucy lie the sight touch i devotion be so rare and we be so grateful to those who show it unaske to those we love here be a poor girl put aside the terror which she naturally have of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she love so that the poor clay might not be lonely till lay to eternal rest i must have sleep long and soundly for it be broad daylight when van helsing wake i by come into my room he come over to my bedside and you need not trouble about the knife we shall not do it why not i ask for his solemnity of the night before have greatly impress i because he say sternly it be too late or too early see here he hold up the little golden crucifix this be steal in the night how steal i ask in wonder since you have it now because i get it back from the worthless wretch who steal it from the woman who rob the dead and the living her punishment will surely come but not through i she know not altogether what she do and thus unknowing she only stole now we must wait he go away on the word leave i with a new mystery to think of a new puzzle to grapple with the forenoon be a dreary time but at noon the solicitor come marquand of wholeman sons marquand lidderdale he be very genial and very appreciative of what we have do and take off our hand all care as to detail during lunch he tell we that westenra have for some time expect sudden death from her heart and have put her affair in absolute order he inform we that with the exception of a certain entail property of lucy father which now in default of direct issue go back to a distant branch of the family the whole estate real and personal be leave absolutely to arthur holmwood when he have tell we so much he go frankly we do our good to prevent such a testamentary disposition and point out certain contingency that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regard a matrimonial alliance indeed we press the matter so far that we almost come into collision for she ask we if we be or be not prepared to carry out her wish of course we have then no alternative but to accept we be right in principle and ninety nine time out of a hundred we should have prove by the logic of event the accuracy of our judgment frankly however i must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have render impossible the carrying out of her wish for by she predecease her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property and even have she only survive her mother by five minute her property would in case there be no will and a will be a practical impossibility in such a case have be treat at her decease as under intestacy in which case lord godalming though so dear a friend would have have no claim in the world and the inheritor be remote would not be likely to abandon their just right for sentimental reason regard an entire stranger i assure you my dear sir i be rejoice at the result perfectly rejoice he be a good fellow but his rejoicing at the one little part in which he be officially interested of so great a tragedy be an object lesson in the limitation of sympathetic understanding he do not remain long but say he would look in later in the day and see lord godalming his come however have be a certain comfort to we since it assure we that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our act arthur be expect at five so a little before that time we visit the death chamber it be so in very truth for now both mother and daughter lie in it the undertaker true to his craft have make the good display he could of his good and there be a mortuary air about the place that lower our spirit at once van helsing order the former arrangement to be adhere to explain that as lord godalming be come very soon it would be less harrowing to his feeling to see all that be leave of his fiancée quite alone the undertaker seem shocked at his own stupidity and exert himself to restore thing to the condition in which we leave they the night before so that when arthur come such shock to his feeling as we could avoid be save poor fellow he look desperately sad and break even his stalwart manhood seem to have shrink somewhat under the strain of his much try emotion he have i know be very genuinely and devotedly attach to his father and to lose he and at such a time be a bitter blow to he with i he be warm as ever and to van helsing he be sweetly courteous but i could not help see that there be some constraint with he the professor notice it too and motion i to bring he upstairs i do so and leave he at the door of the room as i feel he would like to be quite alone with she but he take my arm and lead i in say you love she too old fellow she tell i all about it and there be no friend have a close place in her heart than you i do know how to thank you for all you have do for she i can think yet here he suddenly break down and throw his arm round my shoulder and lay his head on my breast oh jack jack what shall i do the whole of life seem go from i all at once and there be nothing in the wide world for i to live for i comfort he as well as i could in such case man do not need much expression a grip of the hand the tightening of an arm over the shoulder a sob in unison be expression of sympathy dear to a man heart i stand still and silent till his sobs die away and then i say softly to come and look at she together we move over to the bed and i lift the lawn from her face god how beautiful she be every hour seem to be enhance her loveliness it frighten and amaze i somewhat and as for arthur he fall a trembling and finally be shake with doubt as with an ague at last after a long pause he say to i in a faint jack be she really dead i assure he sadly that it be so and go on to suggest for i feel that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment long than i could help that it often happen that after death face become soften and even resolve into their youthful beauty that this be especially so when death have be precede by any acute or prolonged suffering it seem to quite do away with any doubt and after kneel beside the couch for a while and look at her lovingly and long he turn aside i tell he that that must be good bye as the coffin have to be prepare so he go back and take her dead hand in his and kiss it and bent over and kiss her forehead he come away fondly look back over his shoulder at she as he come i leave he in the drawing room and tell van helsing that he have say good bye so the latter go to the kitchen to tell the undertaker man to proceed with the preparation and to screw up the coffin when he come out of the room again i tell he of arthur question and he i be not surprised just now i doubt for a moment myself we all din together and i could see that poor art be try to make the good of thing van helsing have be silent all dinner time but when we have light our cigar he but arthur interrupt no no not that for god sake not yet at any rate forgive i sir i do not mean to speak offensively it be only because my loss be so recent the professor answer very i only use that name because i be in doubt i must not call you and i have grow to love you yes my dear boy to love you as arthur arthur hold out his hand and take the old man warmly call i what you will he say i hope i may always have the title of a friend and let i say that i be at a loss for word to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear he pause a moment and go on i know that she understand your goodness even well than i do and if i be rude or in any way want at that time you act so you professor must forgive i he answer with a grave i know it be hard for you to quite trust i then for to trust such violence need to understand and i take it that you do not that you cannot trust i now for you do not yet understand and there may be more time when i shall want you to trust when you cannot and may not and must not yet understand but the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in i and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shine through then you shall bless i from first to last for your own sake and for the sake of other and for her dear sake to whom i swear to protect and indeed indeed sir say arthur warmly i shall in all way trust you i know and believe you have a very noble heart and you be jack friend and you be her you shall do what you like the professor clear his throat a couple of time as though about to speak and finally may i ask you something now certainly you know that westenra leave you all her property no poor dear i never think of it and as it be all your you have a right to deal with it as you will i want you to give i permission to read all miss lucy paper and letter believe i it be no idle curiosity i have a motive of which be sure she would have approve i have they all here i take they before we know that all be your so that no strange hand might touch they no strange eye look through word into her soul i shall keep they if i may even you may not see they yet but i shall keep they safe no word shall be lose and in the good time i shall give they back to you it a hard thing i ask but you will do it will you not for lucy sake arthur speak out heartily like his old van helsing you may do what you will i feel that in say this i be do what my dear one would have approve i shall not trouble you with question till the time come the old professor stand up as he say and you be right there will be pain for we all but it will not be all pain nor will this pain be the last we and you too you most of all my dear boy will have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet but we must be brave of heart and unselfish and do our duty and all will be well i sleep on a sofa in arthur room that night van helsing do not go to bed at all he go to and fro as if patrol the house and be never out of sight of the room where lucy lie in her coffin strew with the wild garlic flower which send through the odour of lily and rise a heavy overpower smell into the night mina harker journal the train to exeter jonathan sleep it seem only yesterday that the last entry be make and yet how much between they in whitby and all the world

very simple and very solemn there be only ourselves and the servant there one or two old friend of his from exeter his london agent and a gentleman represent sir john paxton the president of the incorporated law society jonathan and i stand hand in hand and we feel that our good and dear friend be go from we we come back to town quietly take a bus to hyde park corner jonathan think it would interest i to go into the row for a while so we sit down but there be very few people there and it be sad looking and desolate to see so many empty chair it make we think of the empty chair at home so we get up and walk down piccadilly jonathan be hold i by the arm the way he use to in old day before i go to school i feel it very improper for you can go on for some year teach etiquette and decorum to other girl without the pedantry of it bite into yourself a bit but it be jonathan and he be my husband and we do know anybody who see we and we do care if they do so on we walk i be look at a very beautiful girl in a big cartwheel hat sit in a victoria outside giuliano when i feel jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt i and he say under his breath my god i be always anxious about jonathan for i fear that some nervous fit may upset he again so i turn to he quickly and ask he what it be that disturb he he be very pale and his eye seem bulge out as half in terror and half in amazement he gaze at a tall thin man with a beaky nose and black moustache and point beard who be also observe the pretty girl he be look at she so hard that he do not see either of we and so i have a good view of he his face be not a good face it be hard and cruel and sensual and his big white tooth that look all the whiter because his lip be so red be point like an animal jonathan keep star at he till i be afraid he would notice i fear he might take it ill he look so fierce and nasty i ask jonathan why he be so disturbed and he answer evidently think that i know as much about it as he do do you see who it be no dear i say i do know he who be it his answer seem to shock and thrill i for it be say as if he do not know that it be to i mina to whom he be it be the man himself the poor dear be evidently terrify at something very greatly terrified i do believe that if he have not have i to lean on and to support he he would have sink down he keep star a man come out of the shop with a small parcel and give it to the lady who then drive off the dark man keep his eye fix on she and when the carriage move up piccadilly he follow in the same direction and hail a hansom jonathan keep look after he and say as if to i believe it be the count but he have grow young my god if this be so oh my god my god if i only know if i only know he be distress himself so much that i fear to keep his mind on the subject by ask he any question so i remain silent i draw he away quietly and he hold my arm come easily we walk a little far and then go in and sit for a while in the green park it be a hot day for autumn and there be a comfortable seat in a shady place after a few minute star at nothing jonathan eye close and he go quietly into a sleep with his head on my shoulder i think it be the good thing for he so do not disturb he in about twenty minute he wake up and say to i quite why mina have i be asleep oh do forgive i for be so rude come and we have a cup of tea somewhere he have evidently forget all about the dark stranger as in his illness he have forget all that this episode have remind he of i do like this lapsing into forgetfulness it may make or continue some injury to the brain i must not ask he for fear i shall do more harm than good but i must somehow learn the fact of his journey abroad the time be come i fear when i must open that parcel and know what be write oh jonathan you will i know forgive i if i do wrong but it be for your own dear sake sad home come in every way the house empty of the dear soul who be so good to we jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady and now a telegram from van helsing whoever he may you will be grieve to hear that westenra die five day ago and that lucy die the day before yesterday they be both bury to day oh what a wealth of sorrow in a few word poor westenra poor lucy gone gone never to return to we and poor poor arthur to have lose such sweetness out of his life god help we all to bear our trouble seward diary be all over arthur have go back to ring and have take quincey morris with he what a fine fellow be quincey i believe in my heart of heart that he suffer as much about lucy death as any of we but he bear himself through it like a moral viking if america can go on breed man like that she will be a power in the world indeed van helsing be lie down have a rest preparatory to his journey he go over to amsterdam to night but say he return to morrow night that he only want to make some arrangement which can only be make personally he be to stop with i then if he can he say he have work to do in london which may take he some time poor old fellow i fear that the strain of the past week have break down even his iron strength all the time of the burial he be i could see put some terrible restraint on himself when it be all over we be stand beside arthur who poor fellow be speak of his part in the operation where his blood have be transfuse to his lucy vein i could see van helsing face grow white and purple by turn arthur be say that he feel since then as if they two have be really marry and that she be his wife in the sight of god none of we say a word of the other operation and none of we ever shall arthur and quincey go away together to the station and van helsing and i come on here the moment we be alone in the carriage he give way to a regular fit of hysteric he have deny to i since that it be hysteric and insist that it be only his sense of humour assert itself under very terrible condition he laugh till he cry and i have to draw down the blind lest any one should see we and misjudge and then he cry till he laugh again and laugh and cry together just as a woman do i try to be stern with he as one be to a woman under the circumstance but it have no effect man and woman be so different in manifestation of nervous strength or weakness then when his face grow grave and stern again i ask he why his mirth and why at such a time his reply be in a way characteristic of he for it be logical and forceful and mysterious he ah you do comprehend friend john do not think that i be not sad though i laugh see i have cry even when the laugh do choke i but no more think that i be all sorry when i cry for the laugh he come just the same keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say may i come in be not the true laughter no he be a king and he come when and how he like he ask no person he choose no time of suitability he say i be here behold in example i grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl i give my blood for she though i be old and worn i give my time my skill my sleep i let my other sufferer want that she may have all and yet i can laugh at her very grave laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say thud thud to my heart till it send back the blood from my cheek my heart blee for that poor boy that dear boy so of the age of mine own boy have i be so blessed that he live and with his hair and eye the same there you know now why i love he so and yet when he say thing that touch my husband heart to the quick and make my father heart yearn to he as to no other man not even to you friend john for we be more level in experience than father and son yet even at such moment king laugh he come to i and shout and bellow in my ear here i be here i be till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with he to my cheek oh friend john it be a strange world a sad world a world full of misery and woe and trouble and yet when king laugh come he make they all dance to the tune he play bleed heart and dry bone of the churchyard and tear that burn as they fall all dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of he and believe i friend john that he be good to come and kind ah we man and woman be like rope draw tight with strain that pull we different way then tear come and like the rain on the rope they brace we up until perhaps the strain become too great and we break but king laugh he come like the sunshine and he ease off the strain again and we bear to go on with our labour what it may be i do not like to wound he by pretend not to see his idea but as i do not yet understand the cause of his laughter i ask he as he answer i his face grow stern and he say in quite a different oh it be the grim irony of it all this so lovely lady garlanded with flower that look so fair as life till one by one we wonder if she be truly dead she lay in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard where rest so many of her kin lay there with the mother who love she and whom she love and that sacred bell go toll toll toll so sad and slow and those holy man with the white garment of the angel pretend to read book and yet all the time their eye never on the page and all we with the bow head and all for what she be dead so be it not well for the life of i professor i say i can see anything to laugh at in all that why your explanation make it a hard puzzle than before but even if the burial service be comic what about poor art and his trouble why his heart be simply break just so say he not that the transfusion of his blood to her vein have make she truly his bride yes and it be a sweet and comforting idea for he quite so but there be a difficulty friend john if so that then what about the other ho ho then this so sweet maid be a polyandrist and i with my poor wife dead to i but alive by church law though no wit all go even i who be faithful husband to this now no wife be bigamist i do see where the joke come in there either i say and i do not feel particularly pleased with he for say such thing he lay his hand on my arm and friend john forgive i if i pain i show not my feeling to other when it would wound but only to you my old friend whom i can trust if you could have look into my very heart then when i want to laugh if you could have do so when the laugh arrive if you could do so now when king laugh have pack up his crown and all that be to he for he go far far away from i and for a long long time maybe you would perhaps pity i the most of all i be touch by the tenderness of his tone and ask why because i know and now we be all scatter and for many a long day loneliness will sit over our roof with brood wing lucy lie in the tomb of her kin a lordly death house in a lonely churchyard away from teem london where the air be fresh and the sun rise over hampstead hill and where wild flower grow of their own accord so i can finish this diary and god only know if i shall ever begin another if i do or if i ever open this again it will be to deal with different people and different theme for here at the end where the romance of my life be tell ere i go back to take up the thread of my life work i say sadly and without hope the westminster gazette september hampstead the neighbourhood of hampstead be just at present exercise with a series of event which seem to run on line parallel to those of what be know to the writer of headline as the kensington horror or the stabbing woman or the woman in black during the past two or three day several case have occur of young child stray from home or neglect to return from their playing on the heath in all these case the child be too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves but the consensus of their excuse be that they have be with a bloofer lady it have always be late in the evening when they have be miss and on two occasion the child have not be find until early in the following morning it be generally suppose in the neighbourhood that as the first child miss give as his reason for be away that a bloofer lady have ask he to come for a walk the other have pick up the phrase and use it as occasion serve this be the more natural as the favourite game of the little one at present be lure each other away by wile a correspondent write we that to see some of the tiny tot pretend to be the bloofer lady be supremely funny some of our caricaturist might he say take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by compare the reality and the picture it be only in accordance with general principle of human nature that the bloofer lady should be the popular rôle at these al fresco performance our correspondent naïvely say that even ellen terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubby face little child pretend and even imagine themselves to be there be however possibly a serious side to the question for some of the child indeed all who have be miss at night have be slightly tear or wound in the throat the wound seem such as might be make by a rat or a small dog and although of not much importance individually would tend to show that whatever animal inflict they have a system or method of its own the police of the division have be instruct to keep a sharp lookout for stray child especially when very young in and around hampstead heath and for any stray dog which may be about the westminster gazette september extra special the hampstead horror child the bloofer lady we have just receive intelligence that another child miss

hear my wife call madam mina by this kindly strong face old man i smile and i be ill i have have a shock but you have cure i already and how by your letter to mina last night i be in doubt and then everything take a hue of unreality and i do not know what to trust even the evidence of my own sens not know what to trust i do not know what to do and so have only to keep on work in what have hitherto be the groove of my life the groove cease to avail i and i mistrust myself doctor you do know what it be to doubt everything even yourself no you do you could with eyebrow like your he seem pleased and laugh as he so you be physiognomist i learn more here with each hour i be with so much pleasure come to you to breakfast and oh sir you will pardon praise from an old man but you be bless in your wife i would listen to he go on praise mina for a day so i simply nod and stand silent she be one of god woman fashion by his own hand to show we man and other woman that there be a heaven where we can enter and that its light can be here on earth so true so sweet so noble so little an egoist and that let i tell you be much in this age so sceptical and selfish and you sir i have read all the letter to poor miss lucy and some of they speak of you so i know you since some day from the knowing of other but i have see your true self since last night you will give i your hand will you not and let we be friend for all our life we shake hand and he be so earnest and so kind that it make i quite choky and now he say may i ask you for some more help i have a great task to do and at the beginning it be to know you can help i here can you tell i what go before your go to transylvania later on i may ask more help and of a different kind but at first this will do look here sir i say do what you have to do concern the count it do he say solemnly then i be with you heart and soul as you go by the train you will not have time to read they but i shall get the bundle of paper you can take they with you and read they in the train after breakfast i see he to the station when we be part he say perhaps you will come to town if i send to you and take madam mina too we shall both come when you will i say i have get he the morning paper and the london paper of the previous night and while we be talk at the carriage window wait for the train to start he be turn they over his eye suddenly seem to catch something in one of they the westminster know it by the colour and he grow quite white he read something intently groan to himself mein gott mein gott so soon so soon i do not think he remember i at the moment just then the whistle blow and the train move off this recall he to himself and he lean out of the window and wave his hand call out love to madam mina i shall write so soon as ever i can seward diary there be no such thing as finality not a week since i say finis and yet here i be start fresh again or rather go on with the same record until this afternoon i have no cause to think of what be do renfield have become to all intent as sane as he ever be he be already well ahead with his fly business and he have just start in the spider line also so he have not be of any trouble to i i have a letter from arthur write on sunday and from it i gather that he be bear up wonderfully well quincey morris be with he and that be much of a help for he himself be a bubble well of good spirit quincey write i a line too and from he i hear that arthur be begin to recover something of his old buoyancy so as to they all my mind be at rest as for myself i be settle down to my work with the enthusiasm which i use to have for it so that i might fairly have say that the wound which poor lucy leave on i be become cicatrise everything be however now reopen and what be to be the end god only know i have an idea that van helsing think he know too but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity he go to exeter yesterday and stay there all night to day he come back and almost bound into my room at about half past five and thrust last night westminster gazette into my hand what do you think of that he ask as he stand back and fold his arm i look over the paper for i really do not know what he mean but he take it from i and point out a paragraph about child be decoy away at hampstead it do not convey much to i until i reach a passage where it describe small punctured wound on their throat an idea strike i and i look up well he say it be like poor lucy and what do make of it simply that there be some cause in common whatever it be that injure she have injure they i do not quite understand his that be true indirectly but not directly how do you mean professor i ask i be a little inclined to take his seriousness lightly for after all four day of rest and freedom from burn harrowing anxiety do help to restore one spirit but when i see his face it sober i never even in the midst of our despair about poor lucy have he look more stern tell i i say i can hazard no opinion i do not know what to think and i have no datum on which to find a conjecture do you mean to tell i friend john that you have no suspicion as to what poor lucy die of not after all the hint give not only by event but by i of nervous prostration follow on great loss or waste of blood and how the blood lose or waste i shake my head he step over and sit down beside i and go you be clever man friend john you reason well and your wit be bold but you be too prejudiced you do not let your eye see nor your ear hear and that which be outside your daily life be not of account to you do you not think that there be thing which you can not understand and yet which be that some people see thing that other can not but there be thing old and new which must not be contemplate by man eye because they know or think they know some thing which other man have tell they ah it be the fault of our science that it want to explain all and if it explain not then it say there be nothing to explain but yet we see around we every day the growth of new belief which think themselves new and which be yet but the old which pretend to be young like the fine lady at the opera i suppose now you do not believe in corporeal transference no nor in materialisation no nor in astral body no nor in the reading of thought no nor in yes i say charcot have prove that pretty well he smile as he go on then you be satisfied as to it yes and of course then you understand how it act and can follow the mind of the great charcot ala that he be no the very soul of the patient that he influence no then friend john be i to take it that you simply accept fact and be satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank no then tell i for i be student of the brain how you accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading let i tell you my friend that there be thing do to day in electrical science which would have be deem unholy by the very man who discover electricity who would themselves not so long before have be burn as wizard there be always mystery in life why be it that methuselah live nine hundred year and old parr one hundred and sixty nine and yet that poor lucy with four man blood in her poor vein could not live even one day for have she live one more day we could have save she do you know all the mystery of life and death do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the quality of brute be in some man and not in other can you tell i why when other spider die small and soon that one great spider live for century in the tower of the old spanish church and grow and grow till on descend he could drink the oil of all the church lamp can you tell i why in the pampas ay and elsewhere there be bat that come at night and open the vein of cattle and horse and suck dry their vein how in some island of the western sea there be bat which hang on the tree all day that those who have see describe as like giant nut or pod and that when the sailor sleep on the deck because that it be hot flit down on they and then and then in the morning be find dead man white as even miss lucy be good god professor i say start up do you mean to tell i that lucy be bite by such a bat and that such a thing be here in london in the nineteenth century he wave his hand for silence and go can you tell i why the tortoise live more long than generation of man why the elephant go on and on till he have see dynasty and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint can you tell i why man believe in all age and place that there be some few who live on always if they be permit that there be man and woman who can not die we all know because science have vouch for the fact that there have be toad shut up in rock for thousand of year shut in one so small hole that only hold he since the youth of the world can you tell i how the indian fakir can make himself to die and have be bury and his grave seal and corn sow on it and the corn reap and be cut and sow and reap and cut again and then man come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the indian fakir not dead but that rise up and walk amongst they as before here i interrupt he i be get bewilder he so crowd on my mind his list of nature eccentricity and possible impossibility that my imagination be get fire i have a dim idea that he be teach i some lesson as long ago he use to do in his study at amsterdam but he use then to tell i the thing so that i could have the object of thought in mind all the time but now i be without his help yet i want to follow he so i professor let i be your pet student again tell i the thesis so that i may apply your knowledge as you go on at present i be go in my mind from point to point as a mad man and not a sane one follow an idea i feel like a novice blunder through a bog in a mist jump from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without know where i be go that be good image he say well i shall tell you my thesis be this i want you to believe to believe what to believe in thing that you can not let i illustrate i hear once of an american who so define faith that which enable we to believe thing which we know to be untrue for one i follow that man he mean that we shall have an open mind and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of a big truth like a small rock do a railway truck we get the small truth first good we keep he and we value he but all the same we must not let he think himself all the truth in the universe then you want i not to let some previous conviction injure the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter do i read your lesson aright ah you be my favourite pupil still it be worth to teach you now that you be willing to understand you have take the first step to understand you think then that those so small hole in the child throat be make by the same that make the hole in miss lucy i suppose so he stand up and say then you be wrong oh would it be so but alas no it be bad far far bad in god name professor van helsing what do you mean i cry he throw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair and place his elbow on the table cover his face with his hand as he they be make by miss lucy,6405
15,CHAPTER 15,chapter xv seward for a while sheer anger master i it be as if he have during her life strike lucy on the face i smite the table hard and rise up as i say to van helsing be you mad he raise his head and look at i and somehow the tenderness of his face calm i at once would i be he say madness be easy to bear compare with truth like this oh my friend why think you do i go so far round why take so long to tell you so simple a thing be it because i hate you and have hat you all my life be it because i wish to give you pain be it that i want now so late revenge for that time when you save my life and from a fearful death ah no forgive i say he go my friend it be because i wish to be gentle in the breaking to you for i know you have love that so sweet lady but even yet i do not expect you to believe it be so hard to accept at once any abstract truth that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believe the no of it it be more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth and of such a one as miss lucy to night i go to prove it dare you come with i this stagger i a man do not like to prove such a truth byron except from the category jealousy and prove the very truth he most abhor he see my hesitation and the logic be simple no madman logic this time jump from tussock to tussock in a misty fog if it be not true then proof will be relief at bad it will not harm if it be true ah there be the dread yet very dread should help my cause for in it be some need of belief come i tell you what i propose first that we go off now and see that child in the hospital vincent of the north hospital where the paper say the child be be friend of mine and i think of yours since you be in class at amsterdam he will let two scientist see his case if he will not let two friend we shall tell he nothing but only that we wish to learn and and then he take a key from his pocket and hold it up and then we spend the night you and i in the churchyard where lucy lie this be the key that lock the tomb i have it from the coffin man to give to arthur my heart sink within i for i feel that there be some fearful ordeal before we i could do nothing however so i pluck up what heart i could and say that we have well hasten as the afternoon be pass we find the child awake it have have a sleep and take some food and altogether be go on well vincent take the bandage from its throat and show we the puncture there be no mistaking the similarity to those which have be on lucy throat they be small and the edge look fresher that be all we ask vincent to what he attribute they and he reply that it must have be a bite of some animal perhaps a rat but for his own part he be inclined to think that it be one of the bat which be so numerous on the northern height of london out of so many harmless one he say there may be some wild speciman from the south of a more malignant specie some sailor may have bring one home and it manage to escape or even from the zoological gardens a young one may have get loose or one be breed there from a vampire these thing do occur you know only ten day ago a wolf get out and be i believe trace up in this direction for a week after the child be play nothing but red riding hood on the heath and in every alley in the place until this bloofer lady scare come along since when it have be quite a gala time with they even this poor little mite when he wake up today ask the nurse if he might go away when she ask he why he want to go he say he want to play with the bloofer lady i hope say van helsing that when you be send the child home you will caution its parent to keep strict watch over it these fancy to stray be most dangerous and if the child be to remain out another night it would probably be fatal but in any case i suppose you will not let it away for some day certainly not not for a week at least long if the wound be not heal our visit to the hospital take more time than we have reckon on and the sun have dip before we come out when van helsing see how dark it be he there be no hurry it be more late than i think come let we seek somewhere that we may eat and then we shall go on our way we din at jack straw castle along with a little crowd of bicyclist and other who be genially noisy about ten we start from the inn it be then very dark and the scatter lamp make the darkness great when we be once outside their individual radius the professor have evidently note the road we be to go for he go on unhesitatingly but as for i i be in quite a mix up as to locality as we go far we meet few and few people till at last we be somewhat surprised when we meet even the patrol of horse police go their usual suburban round at last we reach the wall of the churchyard which we climb over with some little difficulty for it be very dark and the whole place seem so strange to we we find the westenra tomb the professor take the key open the creaky door and stand back politely but quite unconsciously motion i to precede he there be a delicious irony in the offer in the courtliness of give preference on such a ghastly occasion my companion follow i quickly and cautiously draw the door to after carefully ascertain that the lock be a fall and not a spring one in the latter case we should have be in a bad plight then he fumble in his bag and take out a match box and a piece of candle proceed to make a light the tomb in the daytime and when wreathe with fresh flower have look grim and gruesome enough but now some day afterwards when the flower hang lank and dead their white turn to rust and their green to brown when the spider and the beetle have resume their accustomed dominance when time discolour stone and dust encrust mortar and rusty dank iron and tarnished brass and cloud silver plating give back the feeble glimmer of a candle the effect be more miserable and sordid than could have be imagine it convey irresistibly the idea that life animal life be not the only thing which could pass away van helsing go about his work systematically hold his candle so that he could read the coffin plate and so hold it that the sperm drop in white patch which congeal as they touch the metal he make assurance of lucy coffin another search in his bag and he take out a turnscrew what be you go to do i ask to open the coffin you shall yet be convince straightway he begin take out the screw and finally lift off the lid show the casing of lead beneath the sight be almost too much for i it seem to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have be to have strip off her clothing in her sleep whilst live i actually take hold of his hand to stop he he only say you shall see and again fumble in his bag take out a tiny fret saw strike the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab which make i wince he make a small hole which be however big enough to admit the point of the saw i have expect a rush of gas from the week old corpse we doctor who have have to study our danger have to become accustomed to such thing and i draw back towards the door but the professor never stop for a moment he saw down a couple of foot along one side of the lead coffin and then across and down the other side take the edge of the loose flange he bend it back towards the foot of the coffin and hold up the candle into the aperture motion to i to look i draw near and look the coffin be empty it be certainly a surprise to i and give i a considerable shock but van helsing be unmove he be now more sure than ever of his ground and so emboldened to proceed in his task be you satisfied now friend john he ask i feel all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within i as i answer he i be satisfied that lucy body be not in that coffin but that only prove one thing and what be that friend john that it be not there that be good logic he say so far as it go but how do you how can you account for it not be there perhaps a body snatcher i suggest some of the undertaker people may have steal it i feel that i be speak folly and yet it be the only real cause which i could suggest the professor sigh ah well he say we must have more proof come with i he put on the coffin lid again gather up all his thing and place they in the bag blow out the light and place the candle also in the bag we open the door and go out behind we he close the door and lock it he hand i the key say will you keep it you have well be assure i laugh it be not a very cheerful laugh i be bind to say as i motion he to keep it a key be nothing i say there may be duplicate and anyhow it be not difficult to pick a lock of that kind he say nothing but put the key in his pocket then he tell i to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he could watch at the other i take up my place behind a yew tree and i see his dark figure move until the intervene headstone and tree hide it from my sight it be a lonely vigil just after i have take my place i hear a distant clock strike twelve and in time come one and two i be chill and unnerved and angry with the professor for take i on such an errand and with myself for come i be too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether i have a dreary miserable time suddenly as i turn round i think i see something like a white streak move between two dark yew tree at the side of the churchyard farth from the tomb at the same time a dark mass move from the professor side of the ground and hurriedly go towards it then i too move but i have to go round headstone and rail off tomb and i stumble over graf the sky be overcast and somewhere far off an early cock crew a little way off beyond a line of scatter juniper tree which mark the pathway to the church a white dim figure flit in the direction of the tomb the tomb itself be hide by tree and i could not see where the figure disappear i hear the rustle of actual movement where i have first see the white figure and come over find the professor hold in his arm a tiny child when he see i he hold it out to i and be you satisfied now no i say in a way that i feel be aggressive do you not see the child yes it be a child but who bring it here and be it wound i ask we shall see say the professor and with one impulse we take our way out of the churchyard he carry the sleep child when we have get some little distance away we go into a clump of tree and strike a match and look at the child throat it be without a scratch or scar of any kind be i right i ask triumphantly we be just in time say the professor thankfully we have now to decide what we be to do with the child and so consult about it if we be to take it to a police station we should have to give some account of our movement during the night at least we should have have to make some statement as to how we have come to find the child so finally we decide that we would take it to the heath and when we hear a policeman come would leave it where he could not fail to find it we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could all fall out well at the edge of hampstead heath we hear a policeman heavy tramp and lay the child on the pathway we wait and watch until he see it as he flash his lantern to and fro we hear his exclamation of astonishment and then we go away silently by good chance we get a cab near the spaniards and drive to town i can not sleep so i make this entry but i must try to get a few hour sleep as van helsing be to call for i at noon he insist that i shall go with he on another expedition be two before we find a suitable opportunity for our attempt the funeral hold at noon be all complete and the last straggler of the mourner have take themselves lazily away when look carefully from behind a clump of alder tree we see the sexton lock the gate after he we know then that we be safe till morning do we desire it but the professor tell i that we should not want more than an hour at most again i feel that horrid sense of the reality of thing in which any effort of imagination seem out of place and i realise distinctly the peril of the law which we be incur in our unhallowed work besides i feel it be all so useless outrageous as it be to open a leaden coffin to see if a woman dead nearly a week be really dead it now seem the height of folly to open the tomb again when we know from the evidence of our own eyesight that the coffin be empty i shrug my shoulder however and rest silent for van helsing have a way of go on his own road no matter who remonstrate he take the key open the vault and again courteously motion i to precede the place be not so gruesome as last night but oh how unutterably mean looking when the sunshine stream in van helsing walk over to lucy coffin and i follow he bend over and again force back the leaden flange and then a shock of surprise and dismay shoot through i there lie lucy seemingly just as we have see she the night before her funeral she be if possible more radiantly beautiful than ever and i could not believe that she be dead the lip be red nay red than before and on the cheek be a delicate bloom be this a juggle i say to he be you convinced now say the professor in response and as he speak he put over his hand and in a way that make i shudder pull back the dead lip and show the white tooth see he go on see they be even sharp than before with this and he touch one of the canine tooth and that below little child can be bite be you of belief now friend john once more argumentative hostility wake within i i could not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggest so with an attempt to argue of which i be even at the moment ashame i she may have be place here since last night indeed that be so and by whom i do not know some one have do it and yet she have be dead one week most people in that time would not look so i have no answer for this so be silent van helsing do not seem to notice my silence at any rate he show neither chagrin nor triumph he be look intently at the face of the dead woman raise the eyelid and look at the eye and once more open the lip and examine the tooth then he turn to i and here there be one thing which be different from all record here be some dual life that be not as the common she be bite by the vampire when she be in a trance sleep walk oh you start you do not know that friend john but you shall know it all later and in trance could he well come to take more blood in trance she die and in trance she be un dead too so it be that she differ from all other usually when the un dead sleep at he speak he make a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire be face show what they be but this so sweet that be when she not un dead she go back to the nothing of the common dead there be no malign there see and so it make hard that i must kill she in her sleep this turn my blood cold and it begin to dawn upon i that i be accept van helsing theory but if she be really dead what be there of terror in the idea of kill she he look up at i and evidently see the change in my face for he say almost ah you believe now i answer do not press i too hard all at once i be willing to accept how will you do this bloody work i shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic and i shall drive a stake through her body it make i shudder to think of so mutilate the body of the woman whom i have love and yet the feeling be not so strong as i have expect i be in fact begin to shudder at the presence of this being this un dead as van helsing call it and to loathe it be it possible that love be all subjective or all objective i wait a considerable time for van helsing to begin but he stand as if wrap in thought presently he close the catch of his bag with a snap and i have be think and have make up my mind as to what be good if i do simply follow my inclining i would do now at this moment what be to be do but there be other thing to follow and thing that be thousand time more difficult in that they we do not know this be simple she have yet no life take though that be of time and to act now would be to take danger from she for ever but then we may have to want arthur and how shall we tell he of this if you who see the wound on lucy throat and see the wound so similar on the child at the hospital if you who see the coffin empty last night and full to day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week after she die if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that bring the child to the churchyard and yet of your own sens you do not believe how then can i expect arthur who know none of those thing to believe he doubt i when i take he from her kiss when she be die i know he have forgive i because in some mistaken idea i have do thing that prevent he say good bye as he ought and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman be bury alive and that in most mistake of all we have kill she he will then argue back that it be we mistaken one that have kill she by our idea and so he will be much unhappy always yet he never can be sure and that be the bad of all and he will sometimes think that she he love be bury alive and that will paint his dream with horror of what she must have suffer and again he will think that we may be right and that his so beloved be after all an un dead no i tell he once and since then i learn much now since i know it be all true a hundred thousand time more do i know that he must pass through the bitter water to reach the sweet he poor fellow must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to he then we can act for good all round and send he peace my mind be make up let we go you return home for to night to your asylum and see that all be well as for i i shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way to morrow night you will come to i to the berkeley hotel at ten of the clock i shall send for arthur to come too and also that so fine young man of america that give his blood later we shall all have work to do i come with you so far as piccadilly and there dine for i must be back here before the sun set so we lock the tomb and come away and get over the wall of the churchyard which be not much of a task and drive back to piccadilly note leave by van helsing in his portmanteau berkeley hotel direct to john seward not deliver september friend i write this in case anything should happen i go alone to watch in that churchyard it please i that the un dead miss lucy shall not leave to night that so on the morrow night she may be more eager therefore i shall fix some thing she like not garlic and a crucifix and so seal up the door of the tomb she be young as un dead and will heed moreover these be only to prevent she come out they may not prevail on her wanting to get in for then the un dead be desperate and must find the line of least resistance whatsoever it may be i shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise and if there be aught that may be learn i shall learn it for miss lucy or from she i have no fear but that other to whom be there that she be un dead he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter he be cunning as i know from jonathan and from the way that all along he have fool we when he play with we for miss lucy life and we lose and in many way the un dead be strong he have always the strength in his hand of twenty man even we four who give our strength to miss lucy it also be all to he besides he can summon his wolf and i know not what so if it be that he come thither on this night he shall find i but none other shall until it be too late but it may be that he will not attempt the place there be no reason why he should his hunting ground be more full of game than the churchyard where the un dead woman sleep and one old man watch therefore i write this in case take the paper that be with this the diary of harker and the rest and read they and then find this great un dead and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake though it so that the world may rest from he if it be so farewell seward diary be wonderful what a good night sleep will do for one yesterday i be almost willing to accept van helsing monstrous idea but now they seem to start out lurid before i as outrage on common sense i have no doubt that he believe it all i wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged surely there must be some rational explanation of all these mysterious thing be it possible that the professor can have do it himself he be so abnormally clever that if he go off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fix idea in a wonderful way i be loath to think it and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that van helsing be mad but anyhow i shall watch he carefully i may get some light on the mystery september morning last night at a little before ten arthur and quincey come into van helsing room he tell we all what he want we to do but especially address himself to arthur as if all our will be centre in his he begin by say that he hop we would all come with he too for he say there be a grave duty to be do there you be doubtless surprised at my letter this query be directly address to lord godalming i be it rather upset i for a bit there have be so much trouble around my house of late that i could do without any more i have be curious too as to what you mean quincey and i talk it over but the more we talk the more puzzled we get till now i can say for myself that i about up a tree as to any meaning about anything i too say quincey morris laconically oh say the professor then you be near the beginning both of you than friend john here who have to go a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin it be evident that he recognise my return to my old doubt frame of mind without my say a word then turn to the other two he say with intense i want your permission to do what i think good this night it be i know much to ask and when you know what it be i propose to do you will know and only then how much therefore may i ask that you promise i in the dark so that afterwards though you may be angry with i for a time i must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may be you shall not blame yourself for anything that frank anyhow break in quincey i answer for the professor i do quite see his drift but i swear he honest and that good enough for i i thank you sir say van helsing proudly i have do myself the honour of count you one trusting friend and such endorsement be dear to i he hold out a hand which quincey take then arthur speak van helsing i do quite like to buy a pig in a poke as they say in scotland and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my faith as a christian be concern i can not make such a promise if you can assure i that what you intend do not violate either of these two then i give my consent at once though for the life of i i can not understand what you be drive at i accept your limitation say van helsing and all i ask of you be that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it do not violate your reservation agree say arthur that be only fair and now that the pourparler be over may i ask what it be we be to do i want you to come with i and to come in secret to the churchyard at kingstead arthur face fall as he say in an amazed sort of where poor lucy be bury the professor bow arthur go on and when there to enter the tomb arthur stand up professor be you in earnest or be it some monstrous joke pardon i i see that you be in earnest he sit down again but i could see that he sit firmly and proudly as one who be on his dignity there be silence until he ask and when in the tomb to open the coffin this be too much he say angrily rise again i be willing to be patient in all thing that be reasonable but in this this desecration of the grave of one he fairly choke with indignation the professor look pityingly at he if i could spare you one pang my poor friend he say god know i would but this night our foot must tread in thorny path or later and for ever the foot you love must walk in path of flame arthur look up with set white face and take care sir take care would it not be well to hear what i have to say say van helsing and then you will at least know the limit of my purpose shall i go on that fair enough break in morris after a pause van helsing go on evidently with an miss lucy be dead be it not so yes then there can be no wrong to she but if she be not arthur jump to his foot good god he cry what do you mean have there be any mistake have she be bury alive he groan in anguish that not even hope could soften i do not say she be alive my child i do not think it i go no far than to say that she might be un dead un dead not alive what do you mean be this all a nightmare or what be it there be mystery which man can only guess at which age by age they may solve only in part believe i we be now on the verge of one but i have not do may i cut off the head of dead miss lucy heavens and earth no cry arthur in a storm of passion not for the wide world will i consent to any mutilation of her dead body van helsing you try i too far what have i do to you that you should torture i so what do that poor sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave be you mad that speak such thing or be i mad that listen to they do dare to think more of such a desecration i shall not give my consent to anything you do i have a duty to do in protect her grave from outrage and by god i shall do it van helsing rise up from where he have all the time be seat and say gravely and my lord godalming i too have a duty to do a duty to other a duty to you a duty to the dead and by god i shall do it all i ask you now be that you come with i that you look and listen and if when later i make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than i be then then i shall do my duty whatever it may seem to i and then to follow of your lordship wish i shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you when and where you will his voice break a little and he go on with an accent full of but i beseech you do not go forth in anger with i in a long life of act which be often not pleasant to do and which sometimes do wring my heart i have never have so heavy a task as now believe i that if the time come for you to change your mind towards i one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour for i would do what a man can to save you from sorrow just think for why should i give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow i have come here from my own land to do what i can of good at the first to please my friend john and then to help a sweet young lady whom too i come to love for she i be ashamed to say so much but i say it in kindness i give what you give the blood of my vein i give it i who be not like you her lover but only her physician and her friend i give to she my night and day before death after death and if my death can do she good even now when she be the dead un dead she shall have it freely he say this with a very grave sweet pride and arthur be much affect by it he take the old man hand and say in a broken oh it be hard to think of it and i can not understand but at least i will go with you and wait,5801
16,CHAPTER 16,chapter xvi seward it be just a quarter before twelve when we get into the churchyard over the low wall the night be dark with occasional gleam of moonlight between the rent of the heavy cloud that scud across the sky we all keep somehow close together with van helsing slightly in front as he lead the way when we have come close to the tomb i look well at arthur for i fear that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset he but he bear himself well i take it that the very mystery of the proceeding tend in some way a counteractent to his grief the professor unlock the door and see a natural hesitation amongst we for various reason solve the difficulty by enter first himself the rest of we follow and he close the door he then light a dark lantern and point to the coffin arthur step forward hesitatingly van helsing say to you be with i here yesterday be the body of miss lucy in that coffin it be the professor turn to the rest you hear and yet there be one who do not believe with i he take his screwdriver and again take off the lid of the coffin arthur look on very pale but silent when the lid be remove he step forward he evidently do not know that there be a leaden coffin or at any rate have not think of it when he see the rent in the lead the blood rush to his face for an instant but as quickly fall away again so that he remain of a ghastly whiteness he be still silent van helsing force back the leaden flange and we all look in and recoil the coffin be empty for several minute no one speak a word the silence be break by quincey professor i answer for you your word be all i want i would ask such a thing ordinarily i would so dishonour you as to imply a doubt but this be a mystery that go beyond any honour or dishonour be this your doing i swear to you by all that i hold sacred that i have not remove nor touch she what happen be this two night ago my friend seward and i come here with good purpose believe i i open that coffin which be then seal up and we find it as now empty we then wait and see something white come through the tree the next day we come here in daytime and she lie there do she not friend john yes that night we be just in time one more so small child be miss and we find it thank god unharmed amongst the graf yesterday i come here before sundown for at sundown the un dead can move i wait here all the night till the sun rise but i see nothing it be most probable that it be because i have lay over the clamp of those door garlic which the un dead can not bear and other thing which they shun last night there be no exodus so to night before the sundown i take away my garlic and other thing and so it be we find this coffin empty but bear with i so far there be much that be strange wait you with i outside unseen and unheard and thing much strange be yet to be he shut the dark slide of his to the outside he open the door and we file out he come last and lock the door behind he oh but it seem fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault how sweet it be to see the cloud race by and the brief gleam of the moonlight between the scudding cloud cross and pass like the gladness and sorrow of a man life how sweet it be to breathe the fresh air that have no taint of death and decay how humanise to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill and to hear far away the muffled roar that mark the life of a great city each in his own way be solemn and overcome arthur be silent and be i could see strive to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery i be myself tolerably patient and half incline again to throw aside doubt and to accept van helsing conclusion quincey morris be phlegmatic in the way of a man who accept all thing and accept they in the spirit of cool bravery with hazard of all he have to stake not be able to smoke he cut himself a good sized plug of tobacco and begin to chew as to van helsing he be employ in a definite way first he take from his bag a mass of what look like thin wafer like biscuit which be carefully roll up in a white napkin next he take out a double handful of some whitish stuff like dough or putty he crumble the wafer up fine and work it into the mass between his hand this he then take and roll it into thin strip begin to lay they into the crevice between the door and its setting in the tomb i be somewhat puzzled at this and be close ask he what it be that he be do arthur and quincey draw near also as they too be curious he i be close the tomb so that the un dead may not enter and be that stuff you have put there go to do it ask quincey great scott be this a game it be what be that which you be use this time the question be by arthur van helsing reverently lift his hat as he the host i bring it from amsterdam i have an indulgence it be an answer that appal the most sceptical of we and we feel individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the professor a purpose which could thus use the to he most sacred of thing it be impossible to distrust in respectful silence we take the place assign to we close round the tomb but hide from the sight of any one approach i pity the other especially arthur i have myself be apprentice by my former visit to this watch horror and yet i who have up to an hour ago repudiate the proof feel my heart sink within i never do tomb look so ghastly white never do cypress or yew or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom never do tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously never do bough creak so mysteriously and never do the far away howling of dog send such a woeful presage through the night there be a long spell of silence a big ache void and then from the professor a keen s s s s he point and far down the avenue of yew we see a white figure advance a dim white figure which hold something dark at its breast the figure stop and at the moment a ray of moonlight fall between the mass of drive cloud and show in startling prominence a dark haired woman dress in the cerement of the grave we could not see the face for it be bent down over what we see to be a fair haired child there be a pause and a sharp little cry such as a child give in sleep or a dog as it lie before the fire and dream we be start forward but the professor warning hand see by we as he stand behind a yew tree keep we back and then as we look the white figure move forwards again it be now near enough for we to see clearly and the moonlight still hold my own heart grow cold as ice and i could hear the gasp of arthur as we recognise the feature of lucy westenra lucy westenra but yet how change the sweetness be turn to adamantine heartless cruelty and the purity to voluptuous wantonness van helsing step out and obedient to his gesture we all advance too the four of we range in a line before the door of the tomb van helsing raise his lantern and draw the slide by the concentrated light that fall on lucy face we could see that the lip be crimson with fresh blood and that the stream have trickle over her chin and stain the purity of her lawn death robe we shudder with horror i could see by the tremulous light that even van helsing iron nerve have fail arthur be next to i and if i have not seize his arm and hold he up he would have fall when lucy i call the thing that be before we lucy because it bear her shape see we she draw back with an angry snarl such as a cat give when take unawares then her eye range over we lucy eye in form and colour but lucy eye unclean and full of hell fire instead of the pure gentle orb we know at that moment the remnant of my love pass into hate and loathing have she then to be kill i could have do it with savage delight as she look her eye blaze with unholy light and the face become wreathe with a voluptuous smile oh god how it make i shudder to see it with a careless motion she fling to the ground callous as a devil the child that up to now she have clutch strenuously to her breast growl over it as a dog growl over a bone the child give a sharp cry and lie there moaning there be a cold bloodedness in the act which wring a groan from arthur when she advance to he with outstretched arm and a wanton smile he fall back and hide his face in his hand she still advance however and with a languorous voluptuous grace come to i arthur leave these other and come to i my arm be hungry for you come and we can rest together come my husband come there be something diabolically sweet in her tone something of the tingling of glass when strike which ring through the brain even of we who hear the word address to another as for arthur he seem under a spell move his hand from his face he open wide his arm she be leap for they when van helsing spring forward and hold between they his little golden crucifix she recoil from it and with a suddenly distort face full of rage dash past he as if to enter the tomb when within a foot or two of the door however she stop as if arrest by some irresistible force then she turn and her face be show in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp which have now no quiver from van helsing iron nerve never do i see such baffle malice on a face and never i trust shall such ever be see again by mortal eye the beautiful colour become livid the eye seem to throw out spark of hell fire the brow be wrinkle as though the fold of the flesh be the coil of medusa snake and the lovely blood stain mouth grow to an open square as in the passion mask of the greeks and japanese if ever a face mean death if look could kill we see it at that moment and so for full half a minute which seem an eternity she remain between the lift crucifix and the sacred closing of her mean of entry van helsing break the silence by ask answer i oh my friend be i to proceed in my work arthur throw himself on his knee and hide his face in his hand as he do as you will friend do as you will there can be no horror like this ever any more and he groan in spirit quincey and i simultaneously move towards he and take his arm we could hear the click of the closing lantern as van helsing hold it down come close to the tomb he begin to remove from the chink some of the sacred emblem which he have place there we all look on in horrified amazement as we see when he stand back the woman with a corporeal body as real at the moment as our own pass in through the interstice where scarce a knife blade could have go we all feel a glad sense of relief when we see the professor calmly restore the string of putty to the edge of the door when this be do he lift the child and come now my friend we can do no more till to morrow there be a funeral at noon so here we shall all come before long after that the friend of the dead will all be go by two and when the sexton lock the gate we shall remain then there be more to do but not like this of to night as for this little one he be not much harm and by to morrow night he shall be well we shall leave he where the police will find he as on the other night and then to home come close to arthur he my friend arthur you have have sore trial but after when you will look back you will see how it be necessary you be now in the bitter water my child by this time tomorrow you will please god have pass they and have drunk of the sweet water so do not mourn overmuch till then i shall not ask you to forgive i arthur and quincey come home with i and we try to cheer each other on the way we have leave the child in safety and be tired so we all sleep with more or less reality of sleep september little before twelve we three arthur quincey morris and myself call for the professor it be odd to notice that by common consent we have all put on black clothe of course arthur wear black for he be in deep mourning but the rest of we wear it by instinct we get to the churchyard by half past one and stroll about keep out of official observation so that when the gravedigger have complete their task and the sexton under the belief that everyone have go have lock the gate we have the place all to ourselves van helsing instead of his little black bag have with he a long leather one something like a cricketing bag it be manifestly of fair weight when we be alone and have hear the last of the footstep die out up the road we silently and as if by order intention follow the professor to the tomb he unlock the door and we enter close it behind we then he take from his bag the lantern which he light and also two wax candle which when light he stick by melt their own end on other coffin so that they might give light sufficient to work by when he again lift the lid off lucy coffin we all look arthur tremble like an aspen and see that the body lie there in all its death beauty but there be no love in my own heart nothing but loathing for the foul thing which have take lucy shape without her soul i could see even arthur face grow hard as he look presently he say to van be this really lucy body or only a demon in her shape it be her body and yet not it but wait a while and you shall see she as she be and be she seem like a nightmare of lucy as she lie there the pointed tooth the bloodstaine voluptuous mouth which it make one shudder to see the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance seem like a devilish mockery of lucy sweet purity van helsing in his methodicalness begin take the various content from his bag and place they ready for use first he take out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder and then a small oil lamp which give out when light in a corner of the tomb gas which burn at fierce heat with a blue flame then his operating knife which he place to hand and last a round wooden stake some two and a half or three inch thick and about three foot long one end of it be harden by char in the fire and be sharpen to a fine point with this stake come a heavy hammer such as in household be use in the coal cellar for break the lump to i a doctor preparation for work of any kind be stimulate and bracing but the effect of these thing on both arthur and quincey be to cause they a sort of consternation they both however keep their courage and remain silent and quiet when all be ready van helsing before we do anything let i tell you this it be out of the lore and experience of the ancient and of all those who have study the power of the un dead when they become such there come with the change the curse of immortality they can not die but must go on age after age add new victim and multiply the evil of the world for all that die from the preying of the un dead become themselves un dead and prey on their kind and so the circle go on ever widen like as the ripple from a stone throw in the water friend arthur if you have meet that kiss which you know of before poor lucy die or again last night when you open your arm to she you would in time when you have die have become nosferatu as they call it in eastern europe and would all time make more of those un dead that so have fill we with horror the career of this so unhappy dear lady be but just begin those child whose blood she suck be not as yet so much the bad but if she live on un dead more and more they lose their blood and by her power over they they come to she and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth but if she die in truth then all cease the tiny wound of the throat disappear and they go back to their play unknowe ever of what have be but of the most blessed of all when this now un dead be make to rest as true dead then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free instead of work wickedness by night and grow more debased in the assimilation of it by day she shall take her place with the other angels so that my friend it will be a blessed hand for she that shall strike the blow that set she free to this i be willing but be there none amongst we who have a well right will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep be not it be my hand that send she to the star it be the hand of he that love she good the hand that of all she would herself have choose have it be to she to choose tell i if there be such a one amongst we we all look at arthur he see too what we all do the infinite kindness which suggest that his should be the hand which would restore lucy to we as a holy and not an unholy memory he step forward and say bravely though his hand tremble and his face be as pale as my true friend from the bottom of my broken heart i thank you tell i what i be to do and i shall not falter van helsing lay a hand on his shoulder and brave lad a moment courage and it be do this stake must be drive through she it will be a fearful ordeal be not deceive in that but it will be only a short time and you will then rejoice more than your pain be great from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air but you must not falter when once you have begin only think that we your true friend be round you and that we pray for you all the time go on say arthur hoarsely tell i what i be to do take this stake in your left hand ready to place the point over the heart and the hammer in your right then when we begin our prayer for the dead i shall read he i have here the book and the other shall follow strike in god name that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the un dead pass away arthur take the stake and the hammer and when once his mind be set on action his hand never tremble nor even quiver van helsing open his missal and begin to read and quincey and i follow as well as we could arthur place the point over the heart and as i look i could see its dint in the white flesh then he strike with all his might the thing in the coffin writhe and a hideous blood curdle screech come from the open red lip the body shake and quiver and twist in wild contortion the sharp white tooth champ together till the lip be cut and the mouth be smear with a crimson foam but arthur never falter he look like a figure of thor as his untremble arm rise and fall drive deeply and deep the mercy bear stake whilst the blood from the pierce heart well and spurt up around it his face be set and high duty seem to shine through it the sight of it give we courage so that our voice seem to ring through the little vault and then the writhing and quiver of the body become less and the tooth cease to champ and the face to quiver finally it lie still the terrible task be over the hammer fall from arthur hand he reel and would have fall have we not catch he great drop of sweat spring out on his forehead and his breath come in broken gasp it have indeed be an awful strain on he and have he not be force to his task by more than human consideration he could never have go through with it for a few minute we be so take up with he that we do not look towards the coffin when we do however a murmur of startle surprise run from one to the other of we we gaze so eagerly that arthur rise for he have be seat on the ground and come and look too and then a glad strange light break over his face and dispel altogether the gloom of horror that lie upon it there in the coffin lie no long the foul thing that we have so dread and grow to hate that the work of her destruction be yield as a privilege to the one well entitle to it but lucy as we have see she in her life with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity true that there be there as we have see they in life the trace of care and pain and waste but these be all dear to we for they mark her truth to what we know one and all we feel that the holy calm that lie like sunshine over the waste face and form be only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that be to reign for ever van helsing come and lay his hand on arthur shoulder and say to and now arthur my friend dear lad be i not forgive the reaction of the terrible strain come as he take the old man hand in his and raise it to his lip press it and forgiven god bless you that you have give my dear one her soul again and i peace he put his hand on the professor shoulder and lay his head on his breast cry for a while silently whilst we stand unmove when he raise his head van helsing say to and now my child you may kiss she kiss her dead lip if you will as she would have you to if for she to choose for she be not a grinning devil now not any more a foul thing for all eternity no long she be the devil un dead she be god true dead whose soul be with he arthur bend and kiss she and then we send he and quincey out of the tomb the professor and i sawed the top off the stake leave the point of it in the body then we cut off the head and fill the mouth with garlic we solder up the leaden coffin screw on the coffin lid and gather up our belonging come away when the professor lock the door he give the key to arthur outside the air be sweet the sun shine and the bird sing and it seem as if all nature be tune to a different pitch there be gladness and mirth and peace everywhere for we be at rest ourselves on one account and we be glad though it be with a temper joy before we move away van helsing now my friend one step of our work be do one the most harrowing to ourselves but there remain a great task to find out the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp he out i have clue which we can follow but it be a long task and a difficult and there be danger in it and pain shall you not all help i we have learn to believe all of we be it not so and since so do we not see our duty yes and do we not promise to go on to the bitter end each in turn we take his hand and the promise be make then say the professor as we move two night hence you shall meet with i and dine together at seven of the clock with friend john i shall entreat two other two that you know not as yet and i shall be ready to all our work show and our plan unfold friend john you come with i home for i have much to consult about and you can help i to night i leave for amsterdam but shall return to morrow night and then begin our great quest but first i shall have much to say so that you may know what be to do and to dread then our promise shall be make to each other anew for there be a terrible task before we and once our foot be on the ploughshare we must not draw back,4557

you have keep diary of all these so strange thing be it not so yes then we shall go through all these together when that we meet he then make ready for his departure and shortly after drive off to liverpool street i take my way to paddington where i arrive about fifteen minute before the train come in the crowd melt away after the bustling fashion common to arrival platform and i be begin to feel uneasy lest i might miss my guest when a sweet faced dainty look girl step up to i and after a quick glance say seward be it not and you be harker i answer at once whereupon she hold out her hand i know you from the description of poor dear lucy she stop suddenly and a quick blush overspread her face the blush that rise to my own cheek somehow set we both at ease for it be a tacit answer to her own i get her luggage which include a typewriter and we take the underground to fenchurch street after i have send a wire to my housekeeper to have a sit room and bedroom prepare at once for harker in due time we arrive she know of course that the place be a lunatic asylum but i could see that she be unable to repress a slight shudder when we enter she tell i that if she might she would come presently to my study as she have much to say so here i be finish my entry in my phonograph diary whilst i await she as yet i have not have the chance of look at the paper which van helsing leave with i though they lie open before i i must get she interested in something so that i may have an opportunity of read they she do not know how precious time be or what a task we have in hand i must be careful not to frighten she here she be harker i have tidy myself i go down to seward study at the door i pause a moment for i think i hear he talk with some one as however he have press i to be quick i knock at the door and on his call out come in i enter to my intense surprise there be no one with he he be quite alone and on the table opposite he be what i know at once from the description to be a phonograph i have never see one and be much interested i hope i do not keep you wait i say but i stay at the door as i hear you talk and think there be some one with you oh he reply with a smile i be only enter my diary your diary i ask he in surprise yes he answer i keep it in this as he speak he lay his hand on the phonograph i feel quite excited over it and blurt why this beat even shorthand may i hear it say something certainly he reply with alacrity and stand up to put it in train for speak then he pause and a troubled look overspread his face the fact be he begin awkwardly i only keep my diary in it and as it be entirely almost entirely about my case it may be awkward that is i he stop and i try to help he out of his you help to attend dear lucy at the end let i hear how she die for all that i can know of she i shall be very grateful she be very very dear to i to my surprise he answer with a horrorstruck look in his tell you of her death not for the wide world why not i ask for some grave terrible feeling be come over i again he pause and i could see that he be try to invent an excuse at length he stammer you see i do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary even while he be speak an idea dawn upon he and he say with unconscious simplicity in a different voice and with the naïveté of a child that quite true upon my honour honest indian i could not but smile at which he grimace i give myself away that time he say but do you know that although i have keep the diary for month past it never once strike i how i be go to find any particular part of it in case i want to look it up by this time my mind be make up that the diary of a doctor who attend lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible being and i say then seward you have well let i copy it out for you on my typewriter he grow to a positively deathly pallor as he no no no for all the world i would let you know that terrible story then it be terrible my intuition be right for a moment i think and as my eye range the room unconsciously look for something or some opportunity to aid i they light on the great batch of typewrite on the table his eye catch the look in mine and without his thinking follow their direction as they see the parcel he realise my meaning you do not know i i say when you have read those paper my own diary and my husband also which i have type you will know i well i have not falter in give every thought of my own heart in this cause but of course you do not know i yet and i must not expect you to trust i so far he be certainly a man of noble nature poor dear lucy be right about he he stand up and open a large drawer in which be arrange in order a number of hollow cylinder of metal cover with dark wax and you be quite right i do not trust you because i do not know you but i know you now and let i say that i should have know you long ago i know that lucy tell you of i she tell i of you too may i make the only atonement in my power take the cylinder and hear they the first half dozen of they be personal to i and they will not horrify you then you will know i well dinner will by then be ready in the meantime i shall read over some of these document and shall be well able to understand certain thing he carry the phonograph himself up to my sitting room and adjust it for i now i shall learn something pleasant i be sure for it will tell i the other side of a true love episode of which i know one side already seward diary be so absorb in that wonderful diary of jonathan harker and that other of his wife that i let the time run on without think harker be not down when the maid come to announce dinner so i say she be possibly tired let dinner wait an hour and i go on with my work i have just finish harker diary when she come in she look sweetly pretty but very sad and her eye be flush with cry this somehow move i much of late i have have cause for tear god know but the relief of they be deny i and now the sight of those sweet eye brighten with recent tear go straight to my heart so i say as gently as i i greatly fear i have distress you oh no not distress i she reply but i have be more touch than i can say by your grief that be a wonderful machine but it be cruelly true it tell i in its very tone the anguish of your heart it be like a soul cry out to almighty god no one must hear they speak ever again see i have try to be useful i have copy out the word on my typewriter and none other need now hear your heart beat as i do no one need ever know shall ever know i say in a low voice she lay her hand on mine and say very ah but they must must but why i ask because it be a part of the terrible story a part of poor dear lucy death and all that lead to it because in the struggle which we have before we to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get i think that the cylinder which you give i contain more than you intend i to know but i can see that there be in your record many light to this dark mystery you will let i help will you not i know all up to a certain point and i see already though your diary only take i to september how poor lucy be beset and how her terrible doom be be work out jonathan and i have be work day and night since professor van helsing see we he be go to whitby to get more information and he will be here to morrow to help we we need have no secret amongst we work together and with absolute trust we can surely be strong than if some of we be in the dark she look at i so appealingly and at the same time manifest such courage and resolution in her bearing that i give in at once to her wish you shall i say do as you like in the matter god forgive i if i do wrong there be terrible thing yet to learn of but if you have so far travel on the road to poor lucy death you will not be content i know to remain in the dark nay the end the very end may give you a gleam of peace come there be dinner we must keep one another strong for what be before we we have a cruel and dreadful task when you have eat you shall learn the rest and i will answer any question you ask if there be anything which you do not understand though it be apparent to we who be present harker dinner i come with seward to his study he bring back the phonograph from my room and i take my typewriter he place i in a comfortable chair and arrange the phonograph so that i could touch it without get up and show i how to stop it in case i should want to pause then he very thoughtfully take a chair with his back to i so that i might be as free as possible and begin to read i put the fork metal to my ear and listen when the terrible story of lucy death and and all that follow be do i lay back in my chair powerless fortunately i be not of a fainting disposition when seward see i he jump up with a horrified exclamation and hurriedly take a case bottle from a cupboard give i some brandy which in a few minute somewhat restore i my brain be all in a whirl and only that there come through all the multitude of horror the holy ray of light that my dear dear lucy be at last at peace i do not think i could have bear it without make a scene it be all so wild and mysterious and strange that if i have not know jonathan experience in transylvania i could not have believe as it be i do know what to believe and so get out of my difficulty by attend to something else i take the cover off my typewriter and say to let i write this all out now we must be ready for van helsing when he come i have send a telegram to jonathan to come on here when he arrive in london from whitby in this matter date be everything and i think that if we get all our material ready and have every item put in chronological order we shall have do much you tell i that lord godalming and morris be come too let we be able to tell they when they come he accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace and i begin to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder i use manifold and so take three copy of the diary just as i have do with all the rest it be late when i get through but seward go about his work of go his round of the patient when he have finish he come back and sit near i read so that i do not feel too lonely whilst i work how good and thoughtful he be the world seem full of good man even if there be monster in it before i leave he i remember what jonathan put in his diary of the professor perturbation at read something in an evening paper at the station at exeter so see that seward keep his newspaper i borrow the file of the westminster gazette and the pall mall gazette and take they to my room i remember how much the dailygraph and the whitby gazette of which i have make cutting help we to understand the terrible event at whitby when count dracula land so i shall look through the evening paper since then and perhaps i shall get some new light i be not sleepy and the work will help to keep i quiet seward diary harker arrive at nine he have get his wife wire just before start he be uncommonly clever if one can judge from his face and full of energy if his journal be true and judge by one own wonderful experience it must be he be also a man of great nerve that go down to the vault a second time be a remarkable piece of daring after read his account of it i be prepared to meet a good speciman of manhood but hardly the quiet business like gentleman who come here to day lunch harker and his wife go back to their own room and as i pass a while ago i hear the click of the typewriter they be hard at it harker say that they be knit together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have harker have get the letter between the consignee of the box at whitby and the carrier in london who take charge of they he be now read his wife typescript of my diary i wonder what they make out of it here he be strange that it never strike i that the very next house might be the count hiding place goodness know that we have enough clue from the conduct of the patient renfield the bundle of letter relate to the purchase of the house be with the typescript oh if we have only have they early we might have save poor lucy stop that way madness lie harker have go back and be again collate his material he say that by dinner time they will be able to show a whole connected narrative he think that in the meantime i should see renfield as hitherto he have be a sort of index to the coming and go of the count i hardly see this yet but when i get at the date i suppose i shall what a good thing that harker put my cylinder into type we never could have find the date otherwise i find renfield sit placidly in his room with his hand fold smile benignly at the moment he seem as sane as any one i ever see i sit down and talk with he on a lot of subject all of which he treat naturally he then of his own accord speak of go home a subject he have never mention to my knowledge during his sojourn here in fact he speak quite confidently of get his discharge at once i believe that have i not have the chat with harker and read the letter and the date of his outburst i should have be prepare to sign for he after a brief time of observation as it be i be darkly suspicious all those outbreak be in some way link with the proximity of the count what then do this absolute content mean can it be that his instinct be satisfied as to the vampire ultimate triumph stay he be himself zoophagous and in his wild raving outside the chapel door of the deserted house he always speak of master this all seem confirmation of our idea however after a while i come away my friend be just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe he too deep with question he might begin to think and so i come away i mistrust these quiet mood of his so i have give the attendant a hint to look closely after he and to have a strait waistcoat ready in case of need jonathan harker journal september in train to i receive billington courteous message that he would give i any information in his power i think it well to go down to whitby and make on the spot such inquiry as i want it be now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the count to its place in london later we may be able to deal with it billington junior a nice lad meet i at the station and bring i to his father house where they have decide that i must stay the night they be hospitable with true yorkshire hospitality give a guest everything and leave he free to do as he like they all know that i be busy and that my stay be short and billington have ready in his office all the paper concern the consignment of box it give i almost a turn to see again one of the letter which i have see on the count table before i know of his diabolical plan everything have be carefully think out and do systematically and with precision he seem to have be prepare for every obstacle which might be place by accident in the way of his intention be carry out to use an americanism he have take no chance and the absolute accuracy with which his instruction be fulfil be simply the logical result of his care i see the invoice and take note of it fifty case of common earth to be use for experimental purpose also the copy of letter to carter paterson and their reply of both of these i get copy this be all the information billington could give i so i go down to the port and see the coastguard the customs officer and the harbour master they have all something to say of the strange entry of the ship which be already take its place in local tradition but no one could add to the simple description fifty case of common earth i then see the station master who kindly put i in communication with the man who have actually receive the box their tally be exact with the list and they have nothing to add except that the box be main and mortal heavy and that shift they be dry work one of they add that it be hard line that there be any gentleman such like as yourself squire to show some sort of appreciation of their effort in a liquid form another put in a rider that the thirst then generate be such that even the time which have elapse have not completely allay it needless to add i take care before leave to lift for ever and adequately this source of reproach station master be good enough to give i a line to his old companion the station master at king cross so that when i arrive there in the morning i be able to ask he about the arrival of the box he too put i at once in communication with the proper official and i see that their tally be correct with the original invoice the opportunity of acquire an abnormal thirst have be here limit a noble use of they have however be make and again i be compel to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner from thence i go on to carter paterson central office where i meet with the utmost courtesy they look up the transaction in their day book and letter book and at once telephone to their king cross office for more detail by good fortune the man who do the teaming be wait for work and the official at once send they over send also by one of they the way bill and all the paper connect with the delivery of the box at carfax here again i find the tally agree exactly the carrier man be able to supplement the paucity of the write word with a few detail these be i shortly find connect almost solely with the dusty nature of the job and of the consequent thirst engender in the operator on my affording an opportunity through the medium of the currency of the realm of the allaying at a late period this beneficent evil one of the man that ere ouse be the rummi i ever be in blyme but it ai be touch sence a hundred year there be dust that thick in the place that you might have slep on it without urtin of yer bone an the place be that neglect that yer might ave smell ole jerusalem in it but the ole chapel that take the cike that do i and my mate we thort we would never git out quick enough lor i would take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark have be in the house i could well believe he but if he know what i know he would i think have raise his term of one thing i be now satisfied that all the box which arrive at whitby from varna in the demeter be safely deposit in the old chapel of carfax there should be fifty of they there unless any have since be remove as from seward diary i fear i shall try to see the carter who take away the box from carfax when renfield attack they by follow up this clue we may learn a good deal and i have work all day and we have put all the paper into order mina harker journal be so glad that i hardly know how to contain myself it be i suppose the reaction from the haunt fear which i have have that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on jonathan i see he leave for whitby with as brave a face as i could but i be sick with apprehension the effort have however do he good he be never so resolute never so strong never so full of volcanic energy as at present it be just as that dear good professor van helsing say he be true grit and he improve under strain that would kill a weak nature he come back full of life and hope and determination we have get everything in order for to night i feel myself quite wild with excitement i suppose one ought to pity any thing so hunt as be the count that be just it this thing be not human not even beast to read seward account of poor lucy death and what follow be enough to dry up the spring of pity in one heart godalming and morris arrive early than we expect seward be out on business and have take jonathan with he so i have to see they it be to i a painful meeting for it bring back all poor dear lucy hope of only a few month ago of course they have hear lucy speak of i and it seem that van helsing too have be quite blow my trumpet as morris express it poor fellow neither of they be aware that i know all about the proposal they make to lucy they do not quite know what to say or do as they be ignorant of the amount of my knowledge so they have to keep on neutral subject however i think the matter over and come to the conclusion that the good thing i could do would be to post they in affair right up to date i know from seward diary that they have be at lucy death her real death and that i need not fear to betray any secret before the time so i tell they as well as i could that i have read all the paper and diary and that my husband and i have typewrite they have just finish put they in order i give they each a copy to read in the library when lord godalming get his and turn it over it do make a pretty good pile he do you write all this harker i nod and he go i do quite see the drift of it but you people be all so good and kind and have be work so earnestly and so energetically that all i can do be to accept your idea blindfold and try to help you i have have one lesson already in accept fact that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life besides i know you love my poor here he turn away and cover his face with his hand i could hear the tear in his voice morris with instinctive delicacy just lay a hand for a moment on his shoulder and then walk quietly out of the room i suppose there be something in woman nature that make a man free to break down before she and express his feeling on the tender or emotional side without feel it derogatory to his manhood for when lord godalming find himself alone with i he sit down on the sofa and give way utterly and openly i sit down beside he and take his hand i hope he do think it forward of i and that if he ever think of it afterwards he never will have such a thought there i wrong he i know he never will he be too true a gentleman i say to he for i could see that his heart be i love dear lucy and i know what she be to you and what you be to she she and i be like sister and now she be go will you not let i be like a sister to you in your trouble i know what sorrow you have have though i can not measure the depth of they if sympathy and pity can help in your affliction will you let i be of some little service for lucy sake in an instant the poor dear fellow be overwhelm with grief it seem to i that all that he have of late be suffer in silence find a vent at once he grow quite hysterical and raise his open hand beat his palm together in a perfect agony of grief he stand up and then sit down again and the tear rain down his cheek i feel an infinite pity for he and open my arm unthinkingly with a sob he lay his head on my shoulder and cry like a wearied child whilst he shake with emotion we woman have something of the mother in we that make we rise above small matter when the mother spirit be invoke i feel this big sorrow man head rest on i as though it be that of the baby that some day may lie on my bosom and i stroke his hair as though he be my own child i never think at the time how strange it all be after a little bit his sob cease and he raise himself with an apology though he make no disguise of his emotion he tell i that for day and night past weary day and sleepless night he have be unable to speak with any one as a man must speak in his time of sorrow there be no woman whose sympathy could be give to he or with whom owe to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow be surround he could speak freely i know now how i suffer he say as he dry his eye but i do not know even yet and none other can ever know how much your sweet sympathy have be to i to day i shall know well in time and believe i that though i be not ungrateful now my gratitude will grow with my understanding you will let i be like a brother will you not for all our life for dear lucy sake for dear lucy sake i say as we clasp hand ay and for your own sake he add for if a man esteem and gratitude be ever worth the winning you have win mine to day if ever the future should bring to you a time when you need a man help believe i you will not call in vain god grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life but if it should ever come promise i that you will let i know he be so earnest and his sorrow be so fresh that i feel it would comfort he so i i promise as i come along the corridor i see morris look out of a window he turn as he hear my footstep how be art he say then notice my red eye he go on ah i see you have be comfort he poor old fellow he need it no one but a woman can help a man when he be in trouble of the heart and he have no one to comfort he he bear his own trouble so bravely that my heart bleed for he i see the manuscript in his hand and i know that when he read it he would realise how much i know so i say to i wish i could comfort all who suffer from the heart will you let i be your friend and will you come to i for comfort if you need it you will know later on why i speak he see that i be in earnest and stoop take my hand and raise it to his lip kiss it it seem but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul and impulsively i bent over and kiss he the tear rise in his eye and there be a momentary choke in his throat he say quite little girl you will never regret that true hearted kindness so long as ever you live then he go into the study to his friend little very word he have use to lucy and oh but he prove himself a friend,5560
18,CHAPTER 18,chapter xviii seward get home at five and find that godalming and morris have not only arrive but have already study the transcript of the various diary and letter which harker and his wonderful wife have make and arrange harker have not yet return from his visit to the carrier man of whom hennessey have write to i harker give we a cup of tea and i can honestly say that for the first time since i have live in it this old house seem like home when we have finish harker seward may i ask a favour i want to see your patient renfield do let i see he what you have say of he in your diary interest i so much she look so appealing and so pretty that i could not refuse she and there be no possible reason why i should so i take she with i when i go into the room i tell the man that a lady would like to see he to which he simply answer why she be go through the house and want to see every one in it i answer oh very well he say let she come in by all mean but just wait a minute till i tidy up the place his method of tidying be peculiar he simply swallow all the fly and spider in the box before i could stop he it be quite evident that he fear or be jealous of some interference when he have get through his disgusting task he say cheerfully let the lady come in and sit down on the edge of his bed with his head down but with his eyelid raise so that he could see she as she enter for a moment i think that he might have some homicidal intent i remember how quiet he have be just before he attack i in my own study and i take care to stand where i could seize he at once if he attempt to make a spring at she she come into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic for easiness be one of the quality mad people most respect she walk over to he smile pleasantly and hold out her hand good evening renfield say she you see i know you for seward have tell i of you he make no immediate reply but eye she all over intently with a set frown on his face this look give way to one of wonder which merge in doubt then to my intense astonishment he you not the girl the doctor want to marry be you you can be you know for she dead harker smile sweetly as she oh no i have a husband of my own to whom i be marry before i ever see seward or he i i be harker then what be you do here my husband and i be stay on a visit with seward then do stay but why not i think that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to harker any more than it be to i so i join how do you know i want to marry any one his reply be simply contemptuous give in a pause in which he turn his eye from harker to i instantly turn they back what an asinine question i do see that at all renfield say harker at once champion i he reply to she with as much courtesy and respect as he have show contempt to you will of course understand harker that when a man be love and honour as our host be everything regard he be of interest in our little community seward be love not only by his household and his friend but even by his patient who be some of they hardly in mental equilibrium be apt to distort cause and effect since i myself have be an inmate of a lunatic asylum i can not but notice that the sophistic tendency of some of its inmate lean towards the error of non causa and ignoratio elenchi i positively open my eye at this new development here be my own pet lunatic the most pronounced of his type that i have ever meet with talk elemental philosophy and with the manner of a polished gentleman i wonder if it be harker presence which have touch some chord in his memory if this new phase be spontaneous or in any way due to her unconscious influence she must have some rare gift or power we continue to talk for some time and see that he be seemingly quite reasonable she venture look at i questioningly as she begin to lead he to his favourite topic i be again astonish for he address himself to the question with the impartiality of the complete sanity he even take himself as an example when he mention certain thing why i myself be an instance of a man who have a strange belief indeed it be no wonder that my friend be alarmed and insist on my be put under control i use to fancy that life be a positive and perpetual entity and that by consume a multitude of live thing no matter how low in the scale of creation one might indefinitely prolong life at time i hold the belief so strongly that i actually try to take human life the doctor here will bear i out that on one occasion i try to kill he for the purpose of strengthen my vital power by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his blood rely of course upon the scriptural phrase for the blood be the life though indeed the vendor of a certain nostrum have vulgarise the truism to the very point of contempt be that true doctor i nod assent for i be so amazed that i hardly know what i ought to think or say it be hard to imagine that i have see he eat up his spider and fly not five minute before look at my watch i see that i should go to the station to meet van helsing so i tell harker that it be time to leave she come at once after say pleasantly to renfield good bye and i hope i may see you often under auspex pleasanter to yourself to which to my astonishment he good bye my dear i pray god i may never see your sweet face again may he bless and keep you when i go to the station to meet van helsing i leave the boy behind i poor art seem more cheerful than he have be since lucy first take ill and quincey be more like his own bright self than he have be for many a long day van helsing step from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a boy he see i at once and rush up to i ah friend john how go all well so i have be busy for i come here to stay if need be all affair be settle with i and i have much to tell madam mina be with you yes and her so fine husband and arthur and my friend quincey they be with you too good as i drive to the house i tell he of what have pass and of how my own diary have come to be of some use through harker suggestion at which the professor interrupt ah that wonderful madam mina she have man brain a brain that a man should have be he much gifted and woman heart the good god fashion she for a purpose believe i when he make that so good combination friend john up to now fortune have make that woman of help to we after to night she must not have to do with this so terrible affair it be not good that she run a risk so great we man be determine nay be we not destroy this monster but it be no part for a woman even if she be not harm her heart may fail she in so much and so many horror and hereafter she may suffer both in wake from her nerve and in sleep from her dream and besides she be young woman and not so long marry there may be other thing to think of some time if not now you tell i she have write all then she must consult with we but to morrow she say good bye to this work and we go alone i agree heartily with he and then i tell he what we have find in his absence that the house which dracula have buy be the very next one to my own he be amazed and a great concern seem to come on he oh that we have know it before he say for then we might have reach he in time to save poor lucy however the milk that be spilt cry not out afterwards as you say we shall not think of that but go on our way to the end then he fall into a silence that last till we enter my own gateway before we go to prepare for dinner he say to i be tell madam mina by my friend john that you and your husband have put up in exact order all thing that have be up to this moment not up to this moment professor she say impulsively but up to this morning but why not up to now we have see hitherto how good light all the little thing have make we have tell our secret and yet no one who have tell be the bad for it harker begin to blush and take a paper from her pocket she van helsing will you read this and tell i if it must go in it be my record of to day i too have see the need of put down at present everything however trivial but there be little in this except what be personal must it go in the professor read it over gravely and hand it back it need not go in if you do not wish it but pray that it may it can but make your husband love you the more and all we your friend more honour you as well as more esteem and love she take it back with another blush and a bright smile and so now up to this very hour all the record we have be complete and in order the professor take away one copy to study after dinner and before our meeting which be fix for nine the rest of we have already read everything so when we meet in the study we shall all be inform as to fact and can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy mina harker journal we meet in seward study two hour after dinner which have be at six we unconsciously form a sort of board or committee professor van helsing take the head of the table to which seward motion he as he come into the room he make i sit next to he on his right and ask i to act as secretary jonathan sit next to i opposite we be lord godalming seward and morris lord godalming be next to the professor and seward in the centre the professor i may i suppose take it that we be all acquaint with the fact that be in these paper we all express assent and he go then it be i think good that i tell you something of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal i shall then make known to you something of the history of this man which have be ascertain for i so we then can discuss how we shall act and can take our measure accord there be such being as vampire some of we have evidence that they exist even have we not the proof of our own unhappy experience the teaching and the record of the past give proof enough for sane people i admit that at the first i be sceptic be it not that through long year i have train myself to keep an open mind i could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear see see i prove i prove alas have i know at the first what now i know nay have i even guess at he one so precious life have be spar to many of we who do love she but that be go and we must so work that other poor soul perish not whilst we can save the nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once he be only strong and be strong have yet more power to work evil this vampire which be amongst we be of himself so strong in person as twenty man he be of cunning more than mortal for his cunning be the growth of age he have still the aid of necromancy which be as his etymology imply the divination by the dead and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for he at command he be brute and more than brute he be devil in callous and the heart of he be not he can within limitation appear at will when and where and in any of the form that be to he he can within his range direct the element the storm the fog the thunder he can command all the mean thing the rat and the owl and the bat the moth and the fox and the wolf he can grow and become small and he can at time vanish and come unknown how then be we to begin our strife to destroy he how shall we find his where and have find it how can we destroy my friend this be much it be a terrible task that we undertake and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder for if we fail in this our fight he must surely win and then where end we life be nothing i hee he not but to fail here be not mere life or death it be that we become as he that we henceforward become foul thing of the night like he without heart or conscience prey on the body and the soul of those we love well to we for ever be the gate of heaven shut for who shall open they to we again we go on for all time abhor by all a blot on the face of god sunshine an arrow in the side of he who die for man but we be face to face with duty and in such case must we shrink for i i say no but then i be old and life with his sunshine his fair place his song of bird his music and his love lie far behind you other be young some have see sorrow but there be fair day yet in store what say you whilst he be speak jonathan have take my hand i fear oh so much that the appalling nature of our danger be overcome he when i see his hand stretch out but it be life to i to feel its touch so strong so self reliant so resolute a brave man hand can speak for itself it do not even need a woman love to hear its music when the professor have do speak my husband look in my eye and i in his there be no need for speak between we i answer for mina and myself he say count i in professor say quincey morris laconically as usual i be with you say lord godalming for lucy sake if for no other reason seward simply nod the professor stand up and after lay his golden crucifix on the table hold out his hand on either side i take his right hand and lord godalming his left jonathan hold my right with his left and stretch across to morris so as we all take hand our solemn compact be make i feel my heart icy cold but it do not even occur to i to draw back we resume our place and van helsing go on with a sort of cheerfulness which show that the serious work have begin it be to be take as gravely and in as businesslike a way as any other transaction of well you know what we have to contend against but we too be not without strength we have on our side power of combination a power deny to the vampire kind we have resource of science we be free to act and think and the hour of the day and the night be ours equally in fact so far as our power extend they be unfettered and we be free to use they we have self devotion in a cause and an end to achieve which be not a selfish one these thing be much now let we see how far the general power array against we be restrict and how the individual can not in fine let we consider the limitation of the vampire in general and of this one in particular all we have to go upon be tradition and superstition these do not at the first appear much when the matter be one of life and death nay of more than either life or death yet must we be satisfy in the first place because we have to be no other mean be at our control and secondly because after all these thing tradition and superstition be everything do not the belief in vampire rest for other though not alas for we on they a year ago which of we would have receive such a possibility in the midst of our scientific sceptical matter of fact nineteenth century we even scout a belief that we see justify under our very eye take it then that the vampire and the belief in his limitation and his cure rest for the moment on the same base for let i tell you he be know everywhere that man have be in old greece in old rome he flourish in germany all over in france in india even in the chersonese and in china so far from we in all way there even be he and the people fear he at this day he have follow the wake of the berserker icelander the devil beget hun the slav the saxon the magyar so far then we have all we may act upon and let i tell you that very much of the belief be justify by what we have see in our own so unhappy experience the vampire live on and can not die by mere passing of the time he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living even more we have see amongst we that he can even grow young that his vital faculty grow strenuous and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum be plenty but he can not flourish without this diet he eat not as other even friend jonathan who live with he for week do never see he to eat never he throw no shadow he make in the mirror no reflect as again jonathan observe he have the strength of many in his hand witness again jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs and when he help he from the diligence too he can transform himself to wolf as we gather from the ship arrival in whitby when he tear open the dog he can be as bat as madam mina see he on the window at whitby and as friend john see he fly from this so near house and as my friend quincey see he at the window of miss lucy he can come in mist which he create that noble ship captain prove he of this but from what we know the distance he can make this mist be limited and it can only be round himself he come on moonlight ray as elemental dust as again jonathan see those sister in the castle of dracula he become so small we ourselves see miss lucy ere she be at peace slip through a hair breadth space at the tomb door he can when once he find his way come out from anything or into anything no matter how close it be bind or even fuse up with fire solder you call it he can see in the dark no small power this in a world which be one half shut from the light ah but hear i through he can do all these thing yet he be not free nay he be even more prisoner than the slave of the galley than the madman in his cell he can not go where he list he who be not of nature have yet to obey some of nature law why we know not he may not enter anywhere at the first unless there be some one of the household who bid he to come though afterwards he can come as he please his power cease as do that of all evil thing at the coming of the day only at certain time can he have limit freedom if he be not at the place whither he be bind he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset these thing be we tell and in this record of ours we have proof by inference thus whereas he can do as he will within his limit when he have his earth home his coffin home his hell home the place unhallow as we see when he go to the grave of the suicide at whitby still at other time he can only change when the time come it be say too that he can only pass run water at the slack or the flood of the tide then there be thing which so afflict he that he have no power as the garlic that we know of and as for thing sacred as this symbol my crucifix that be amongst we even now when we resolve to they he be nothing but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect there be other too which i shall tell you of lest in our seeking we may need they the branch of wild rise on his coffin keep he that he move not from it a sacred bullet fire into the coffin kill he so that he be true dead and as for the stake through he we know already of its peace or the cut off head that giveth rest we have see it with our eye thus when we find the habitation of this man that be we can confine he to his coffin and destroy he if we obey what we know but he be clever i have ask my friend arminius of buda pesth university to make his record and from all the mean that be he tell i of what he have be he must indeed have be that voivode dracula who win his name against the turk over the great river on the very frontier of turkey land if it be so then be he no common man for in that time and for century after he be speak of as the clever and the most cunning as well as the brave of the son of the land beyond the forest that mighty brain and that iron resolution go with he to his grave and be even now array against we the draculas be say arminius a great and noble race though now and again be scion who be hold by their coeval to have have dealing with the evil one they learn his secret in the scholomance amongst the mountain over lake hermanstadt where the devil claim the tenth scholar as his due in the record be such word as ordog and and hell and in one manuscript this very dracula be speak of as wampyr which we all understand too well there have be from the loin of this very one great man and good woman and their graf make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell for it be not the least of its terror that this evil thing be root deep in all good in soil barren of holy memory it can not rest whilst they be talk morris be look steadily at the window and he now get up quietly and go out of the room there be a little pause and then the professor go and now we must settle what we do we have here much datum and we must proceed to lay out our campaign we know from the inquiry of jonathan that from the castle to whitby come fifty box of earth all of which be deliver at carfax we also know that at least some of these box have be remove it seem to i that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look to day or whether any more have be remove if the latter we must here we be interrupt in a very startling way outside the house come the sound of a pistol shot the glass of the window be shatter with a bullet which ricochet from the top of the embrasure strike the far wall of the room i be afraid i be at heart a coward for i shriek out the man all jump to their foot lord godalming fly over to the window and throw up the sash as he do so we hear morris voice sorry i fear i have alarm you i shall come in and tell you about it a minute later he come in and it be an idiotic thing of i to do and i ask your pardon harker most sincerely i fear i must have frighten you terribly but the fact be that while the professor be talk there come a big bat and sit on the window sill i have get such a horror of the damned brute from recent event that i can not stand they and i go out to have a shot as i have be do of late of evening whenever i have see one you use to laugh at i for it then art do you hit it ask van helsing i do know i fancy not for it fly away into the wood without say any more he take his seat and the professor begin to resume his we must trace each of these box and when we be ready we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair or we must so to speak sterilise the earth so that no more he can seek safety in it thus in the end we may find he in his form of man between the hour of noon and sunset and so engage with he when he be at his most weak and now for you madam mina this night be the end until all be well you be too precious to we to have such risk when we part to night you no more must question we shall tell you all in good time we be man and be able to bear but you must be our star and our hope and we shall act all the more free that you be not in the danger such as we be all the man even jonathan seem relieve but it do not seem to i good that they should brave danger and perhaps lessen their safety strength be the good safety through care of i but their mind be make up and though it be a bitter pill for i to swallow i could say nothing save to accept their chivalrous care of i morris resume the as there be no time to lose i vote we have a look at his house right now time be everything with he and swift action on our part may save another victim i own that my heart begin to fail i when the time for action come so close but i do not say anything for i have a great fear that if i appear as a drag or a hindrance to their work they might even leave i out of their counsel altogether they have now go off to carfax with mean to get into the house manlike they have tell i to go to bed and sleep as if a woman can sleep when those she love be in danger i shall lie down and pretend to sleep lest jonathan have add anxiety about i when he return seward diary october as we be about to leave the house an urgent message be bring to i from renfield to know if i would see he at once as he have something of the utmost importance to say to i i tell the messenger to say that i would attend to his wish in the morning i be busy just at the moment the attendant he seem very importunate sir i have never see he so eager i do know but what if you do see he soon he will have one of his violent fit i know the man would not have say this without some cause so i say all right i go now and i ask the other to wait a few minute for i as i have to go and see my patient take i with you friend john say the professor his case in your diary interested i much and it have bearing too now and again on our case i should much like to see he and especially when his mind be disturb may i come also ask lord godalming i too say quincey morris i nod and we all go down the passage together we find he in a state of considerable excitement but far more rational in his speech and manner than i have ever see he there be an unusual understanding of himself which be unlike anything i have ever meet with in a lunatic and he take it for grant that his reason would prevail with other entirely sane we all four go into the room but none of the other at first say anything his request be that i would at once release he from the asylum and send he home this he back up with argument regard his complete recovery and adduce his own exist sanity i appeal to your friend he say they will perhaps not mind sit in judgment on my case by the way you have not introduce i i be so much astonish that the oddness of introduce a madman in an asylum do not strike i at the moment and besides there be a certain dignity in the man manner so much of the habit of equality that i at once make the introduction lord godalming professor van helsing quincey morris of texas renfield he shake hand with each of they say in lord godalming i have the honour of second your father at the windham i grieve to know by your hold the title that he be no more he be a man love and honour by all who know he and in his youth be i have hear the inventor of a burn rum punch much patronise on derby night morris you should be proud of your great state its reception into the union be a precedent which may have far reach effect hereafter when the pole and the tropics may hold allegiance to the stars and stripes the power of treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement when the monroe doctrine take its true place as a political fable what shall any man say of his pleasure at meet van helsing sir i make no apology for drop all form of conventional prefix when an individual have revolutionise therapeutic by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain matter conventional form be unfit since they would seem to limit he to one of a class you gentleman who by nationality by heredity or by the possession of natural gift be fit to hold your respective place in the move world i take to witness that i be as sane as at least the majority of man who be in full possession of their liberty and i be sure that you seward humanitarian and medico jurist as well as scientist will deem it a moral duty to deal with i as one to be consider as under exceptional circumstance he make this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which be not without its own charm i think we be all stagger for my own part i be under the conviction despite my knowledge of the man character and history that his reason have be restore and i feel under a strong impulse to tell he that i be satisfied as to his sanity and would see about the necessary formality for his release in the morning i think it well to wait however before make so grave a statement for of old i know the sudden change to which this particular patient be liable so i content myself with make a general statement that he appear to be improve very rapidly that i would have a long chat with he in the morning and would then see what i could do in the direction of meet his wish this do not at all satisfy he for he say but i fear seward that you hardly apprehend my wish i desire to go at once here now this very hour this very moment if i may time press and in our imply agreement with the old scytheman it be of the essence of the contract i be sure it be only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as seward so simple yet so momentous a wish to ensure its fulfilment he look at i keenly and see the negative in my face turn to the other and scrutinise they closely not meet any sufficient response he go be it possible that i have err in my supposition you have i say frankly but at the same time as i feel brutally there be a considerable pause and then he say then i suppose i must only shift my ground of request let i ask for this concession boon privilege what you will i be content to implore in such a case not on personal ground but for the sake of other i be not at liberty to give you the whole of my reason but you may i assure you take it from i that they be good one sound and unselfish and spring from the high sense of duty could you look sir into my heart you would approve to the full the sentiment which animate i nay more you would count i amongst the good and truest of your friend again he look at we all keenly i have a grow conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method be but yet another form or phase of his madness and so determined to let he go on a little long know from experience that he would like all lunatic give himself away in the end van helsing be gaze at he with a look of the utmost intensity his bushy eyebrow almost meet with the fix concentration of his look he say to renfield in a tone which do not surprise i at the time but only when i think of it afterwards for it be as of one address an can you not tell frankly your real reason for wish to be free to night i will undertake that if you will satisfy even i a stranger without prejudice and with the habit of keep an open mind seward will give you at his own risk and on his own responsibility the privilege you seek he shake his head sadly and with a look of poignant regret on his face the professor go come sir bethink yourself you claim the privilege of reason in the high degree since you seek to impress we with your complete reasonableness you do this whose sanity we have reason to doubt since you be not yet release from medical treatment for this very defect if you will not help we in our effort to choose the wise course how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon we be wise and help we and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish he still shake his head as he van helsing i have nothing to say your argument be complete and if i be free to speak i should not hesitate a moment but i be not my own master in the matter i can only ask you to trust i if i be refuse the responsibility do not rest with i i think it be now time to end the scene which be become too comically grave so i go towards the door simply come my friend we have work to do good night as however i get near the door a new change come over the patient he move towards i so quickly that for the moment i fear that he be about to make another homicidal attack my fear however be groundless for he hold up his two hand imploringly and make his petition in a moving manner as he see that the very excess of his emotion be militate against he by restore we more to our old relation he become still more demonstrative i glance at van helsing and see my conviction reflect in his eye so i become a little more fixed in my manner if not more stern and motion to he that his effort be unavaile i have previously see something of the same constantly grow excitement in he when he have to make some request of which at the time he have think much such for instance as when he want a cat and i be prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion my expectation be not realise for when he find that his appeal would not be successful he get into quite a frantic condition he throw himself on his knee and hold up his hand wring they in plaintive supplication and pour forth a torrent of entreaty with the tear roll down his cheek and his whole face and form expressive of the deep let i entreat you seward oh let i implore you to let i out of this house at once send i away how you will and where you will send keeper with i with whip and chain let they take i in a strait waistcoat manacle and leg iron even to a gaol but let i go out of this you do know what you do by keep i here i be speak from the depth of my heart of my very soul you do know whom you wrong or how and i may not tell woe be i i may not tell by all you hold sacred by all you hold dear by your love that be lose by your hope that live for the sake of the almighty take i out of this and save my soul from guilt can you hear i man can you understand will you never learn do you know that i be sane and earnest now that i be no lunatic in a mad fit but a sane man fight for his soul oh hear i hear i let i go let i go let i go i think that the long this go on the wilder he would get and so would bring on a fit so i take he by the hand and raise he up come i say sternly no more of this we have have quite enough already get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly he suddenly stop and look at i intently for several moment then without a word he rise and move over sit down on the side of the bed the collapse have come as on former occasion just as i have expect when i be leave the room last of our party he say to i in a quiet well breed you will i trust seward do i the justice to bear in mind later on that i do what i could to convince you tonight,6907
19,CHAPTER 19,chapter xix harker october go with the party to the search with an easy mind for i think i never see mina so absolutely strong and well i be so glad that she consent to hold back and let we man do the work somehow it be a dread to i that she be in this fearful business at all but now that her work be do and that it be due to her energy and brain and foresight that the whole story be put together in such a way that every point tell she may well feel that her part be finish and that she can henceforth leave the rest to we we be i think all a little upset by the scene with renfield when we come away from his room we be silent till we get back to the study then morris say to say jack if that man be attempt a bluff he be about the sane lunatic i ever see i not sure but i believe that he have some serious purpose and if he have it be pretty rough on he not to get a chance lord godalming and i be silent but van helsing friend john you know more of lunatic than i do and i glad of it for i fear that if it have be to i to decide i would before that last hysterical outburst have give he free but we live and learn and in our present task we must take no chance as my friend quincey would say all be good as they be seward seem to answer they both in a dreamy kind of i do know but that i agree with you if that man have be an ordinary lunatic i would have take my chance of trust he but he seem so mixed up with the count in an indexy kind of way that i be afraid of do anything wrong by help his fad i can forget how he pray with almost equal fervour for a cat and then try to tear my throat out with his tooth besides he call the count lord and master and he may want to get out to help he in some diabolical way that horrid thing have the wolf and the rat and his own kind to help he so i suppose he be above try to use a respectable lunatic he certainly do seem earnest though i only hope we have do what be good these thing in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand help to unnerve a man the professor step over and lay a hand on his shoulder say in his grave kindly friend john have no fear we be try to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case we can only do as we deem well what else have we to hope for except the pity of the good god lord godalming have slip away for a few minute but he now return he hold up a little silver whistle as he that old place may be full of rat and if so i get an antidote on call have pass the wall we take our way to the house take care to keep in the shadow of the tree on the lawn when the moonlight shine out when we get to the porch the professor open his bag and take out a lot of thing which he lay on the step sort they into four little group evidently one for each then he my friend we be go into a terrible danger and we need arm of many kind our enemy be not merely spiritual remember that he have the strength of twenty man and that though our neck or our windpipe be of the common kind and therefore breakable or crushable his be not amenable to mere strength a strong man or a body of man more strong in all than he can at certain time hold he but yet they can not hurt he as we can be hurt by he we must therefore guard ourselves from his touch keep this near your he speak he lift a little silver crucifix and hold it out to i i be near to these flower round your he hand to i a wreath of wither garlic other enemy more mundane this revolver and this knife and for aid in all these so small electric lamp which you can fasten to your breast and for all and above all at the last this which we must not desecrate needless this be a portion of sacred wafer which he put in an envelope and hand to i each of the other be similarly equip now he say friend john where be the skeleton key if so that we can open the door we need not break house by the window as before at miss lucy seward try one or two skeleton key his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon stand he in good stead presently he get one to suit after a little play back and forward the bolt yield and with a rusty clang shoot back we press on the door the rusty hinge creak and it slowly open it be startlingly like the image convey to i in seward diary of the opening of miss westenra tomb i fancy that the same idea seem to strike the other for with one accord they shrink back the professor be the first to move forward and step into the open door in manus tuas domine he say cross himself as he pass over the threshold we close the door behind we lest when we should have light our lamp we might possibly attract attention from the road the professor carefully try the lock lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry to make our exit then we all light our lamp and proceed on our search the light from the tiny lamp fall in all sort of odd form as the ray cross each other or the opacity of our body throw great shadow i could not for my life get away from the feeling that there be some one else amongst we i suppose it be the recollection so powerfully bring home to i by the grim surrounding of that terrible experience in transylvania i think the feeling be common to we all for i notice that the other keep look over their shoulder at every sound and every new shadow just as i feel myself do the whole place be thick with dust the floor be seemingly inch deep except where there be recent footstep in which on hold down my lamp i could see mark of hobnail where the dust be cake the wall be fluffy and heavy with dust and in the corner be mass of spider webs whereon the dust have gather till they look like old tattered rag as the weight have tear they partly down on a table in the hall be a great bunch of key with a time yellowed label on each they have be use several time for on the table be several similar rent in the blanket of dust like that expose when the professor lift the key he turn to i and you know this place jonathan you have copy map of it and you know at least more than we do which be the way to the chapel i have an idea of its direction though on my former visit i have not be able to get admission to it so i lead the way and after a few wrong turning find myself opposite a low arch oaken door rib with iron band this be the spot say the professor as he turn his lamp on a small map of the house copy from the file of my original correspondence regard the purchase with a little trouble we find the key on the bunch and open the door we be prepare for some unpleasantness for as we be open the door a faint malodorous air seem to exhale through the gap but none of we ever expect such an odour as we encounter none of the other have meet the count at all at close quarter and when i have see he he be either in the fast stage of his existence in his room or when he be bloated with fresh blood in a ruin building open to the air but here the place be small and close and the long disuse have make the air stagnant and foul there be an earthy smell as of some dry miasma which come through the fouler air but as to the odour itself how shall i describe it it be not alone that it be compose of all the ill of mortality and with the pungent acrid smell of blood but it seem as though corruption have become itself corrupt faugh it sicken i to think of it every breath exhale by that monster seem to have clung to the place and intensify its loathsomeness under ordinary circumstance such a stench would have bring our enterprise to an end but this be no ordinary case and the high and terrible purpose in which we be involve give we a strength which rise above merely physical consideration after the involuntary shrink consequent on the first nauseous whiff we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place be a garden of rose we make an accurate examination of the place the professor say as we the first thing be to see how many of the box be leave we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we can not get some clue as to what have become of the rest a glance be sufficient to show how many remain for the great earth chest be bulky and there be no mistake they there be only twenty nine leave out of the fifty once i get a fright for see lord godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond i look too and for an instant my heart stand still somewhere look out from the shadow i seem to see the high light of the count evil face the ridge of the nose the red eye the red lip the awful pallor it be only for a moment for as lord godalming say i think i see a face but it be only the shadow and resume his inquiry i turn my lamp in the direction and step into the passage there be no sign of any one and as there be no corner no door no aperture of any kind but only the solid wall of the passage there could be no hiding place even for him i take it that fear have help imagination and say nothing a few minute later i see morris step suddenly back from a corner which he be examine we all follow his movement with our eye for undoubtedly some nervousness be grow on we and we see a whole mass of phosphorescence which twinkle like star we all instinctively draw back the whole place be become alive with rat for a moment or two we stand appalled all save lord godalming who be seemingly prepared for such an emergency rush over to the great iron bind oaken door which seward have describe from the outside and which i have see myself he turn the key in the lock draw the huge bolt and swing the door open then take his little silver whistle from his pocket he blow a low shrill call it be answer from behind seward house by the yelping of dog and after about a minute three terrier come dash round the corner of the house unconsciously we have all move towards the door and as we move i notice that the dust have be much disturb the box which have be take out have be bring this way but even in the minute that have elapse the number of the rat have vastly increase they seem to swarm over the place all at once till the lamplight shin on their move dark body and glitter baleful eye make the place look like a bank of earth set with firefly the dog dash on but at the threshold suddenly stop and snarl and then simultaneously lift their nose begin to howl in most lugubrious fashion the rat be multiply in thousand and move out lord godalming lift one of the dog and carry he in place he on the floor the instant his foot touch the ground he seem to recover his courage and rush at his natural enemy they flee before he so fast that before he have shake the life out of a score the other dog who have by now be lift in in the same manner have but small prey ere the whole mass have vanish with their go it seem as if some evil presence have depart for the dog frisk about and bark merrily as they make sudden dart at their prostrate foe and turn they over and over and toss they in the air with vicious shake we all seem to find our spirit rise whether it be the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door or the relief which we experience by find ourselves in the open i know not but most certainly the shadow of dread seem to slip from we like a robe and the occasion of our come lose something of its grim significance though we do not slacken a whit in our resolution we close the outer door and bar and lock it and bring the dog with we begin our search of the house we find nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportion and all untouched save for my own footstep when i have make my first visit never once do the dog exhibit any symptom of uneasiness and even when we return to the chapel they frisk about as though they have be rabbit hunting in a summer wood the morning be quicken in the east when we emerge from the front van helsing have take the key of the hall door from the bunch and lock the door in orthodox fashion put the key into his pocket when he have do so far he say our night have be eminently successful no harm have come to we such as i fear might be and yet we have ascertain how many box be miss more than all do i rejoice that this our first and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous step have be accomplish without the bringing thereinto our most sweet madam mina or trouble her wake or sleeping thought with sight and sound and smell of horror which she might never forget one lesson too we have learn if it be allowable to argue a particulari that the brute beast which be to the count command be yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power for look these rat that would come to his call just as from his castle top he summon the wolf to your going and to that poor mother cry though they come to he they run pell mell from the so little dog of my friend arthur we have other matter before we other danger other fear and that monster he have not use his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to night so be it that he have go elsewhere good it have give we opportunity to cry check in some way in this chess game which we play for the stake of human soul and now let we go home the dawn be close at hand and we have reason to be content with our first night work it may be ordain that we have many night and day to follow if full of peril but we must go on and from no danger shall we shrink the house be silent when we get back save for some poor creature who be scream away in one of the distant ward and a low moan sound from renfield room the poor wretch be doubtless torture himself after the manner of the insane with needless thought of pain i come tiptoe into our own room and find mina asleep breathe so softly that i have to put my ear down to hear it she look pale than usual i hope the meeting to night have not upset she i be truly thankful that she be to be leave out of our future work and even of our deliberation it be too great a strain for a woman to bear i do not think so at first but i know well now therefore i be glad that it be settle there may be thing which would frighten she to hear and yet to conceal they from she might be bad than to tell she if once she suspect that there be any concealment henceforth our work be to be a seal book to she till at least such time as we can tell she that all be finish and the earth free from a monster of the nether world i daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as our but i must be resolute and tomorrow i shall keep dark over to night doing and shall refuse to speak of anything that have happen i rest on the sofa so as not to disturb she october suppose it be natural that we should have all overslept ourselves for the day be a busy one and the night have no rest at all even mina must have feel its exhaustion for though i sleep till the sun be high i be awake before she and have to call two or three time before she awake indeed she be so sound asleep that for a few second she do not recognise i but look at i with a sort of blank terror as one look who have be wake out of a bad dream she complain a little of be tired and i let she rest till later in the day we now know of twenty one box have be remove and if it be that several be take in any of these removal we may be able to trace they all such will of course immensely simplify our labour and the soon the matter be attend to the well i shall look up thomas snelling today seward diary be towards noon when i be awaken by the professor walk into my room he be more jolly and cheerful than usual and it be quite evident that last night work have help to take some of the brood weight off his mind after go over the adventure of the night he suddenly your patient interest i much may it be that with you i visit he this morning or if that you be too occupy i can go alone if it may be it be a new experience to i to find a lunatic who talk philosophy and reason so sound i have some work to do which press so i tell he that if he would go alone i would be glad as then i should not have to keep he wait so i call an attendant and give he the necessary instruction before the professor leave the room i caution he against get any false impression from my patient but he answer i want he to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consume live thing he say to madam mina as i see in your diary of yesterday that he have once have such a belief why do you smile friend john excuse i i say but the answer be here i lay my hand on the typewritten matter when our sane and learn lunatic make that very statement of how he use to consume life his mouth be actually nauseous with the fly and spider which he have eat just before harker enter the room van helsing smile in turn good he say your memory be true friend john i should have remember and yet it be this very obliquity of thought and memory which make mental disease such a fascinating study perhaps i may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than i shall from the teaching of the most wise who know i go on with my work and before long be through that in hand it seem that the time have be very short indeed but there be van helsing back in the study do i interrupt he ask politely as he stand at the door not at all i answer come in my work be finish and i be free i can go with you now if you like it be needless i have see he well i fear that he do not appraise i at much our interview be short when i enter the room he be sit on a stool in the centre with his elbow on his knee and his face be the picture of sullen discontent i speak to he as cheerfully as i could and with such a measure of respect as i could assume he make no reply whatever do you know i i ask his answer be not reassure i know you well enough you be the old fool van helsing i wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theory somewhere else damn all thick headed dutchmen not a word more would he say but sit in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to i as though i have not be in the room at all thus depart for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic so i shall go if i may and cheer myself with a few happy word with that sweet soul madam mina friend john it do rejoice i unspeakable that she be no more to be pain no more to be worry with our terrible thing though we shall much miss her help it be well so i agree with you with all my heart i answer earnestly for i do not want he to weaken in this matter harker be well out of it thing be quite bad enough for we all man of the world and who have be in many tight place in our time but it be no place for a woman and if she have remain in touch with the affair it would in time infallibly have wreck she so van helsing have go to confer with harker and harker quincey and art be both out follow up the clue as to the earth box i shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to night mina harker journal be strange to i to be keep in the dark as i be today after jonathan full confidence for so many year to see he manifestly avoid certain matter and those the most vital of all this morning i sleep late after the fatigue of yesterday and though jonathan be late too he be the early he speak to i before he go out never more sweetly or tenderly but he never mention a word of what have happen in the visit to the count house and yet he must have know how terribly anxious i be poor dear fellow i suppose it must have distress he even more than it do i they all agree that it be good that i should not be draw far into this awful work and i acquiesce but to think that he keep anything from i and now i be cry like a silly fool when i know it come from my husband great love and from the good good wish of those other strong man that have do i good well some day jonathan will tell i all and lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that i keep anything from he i still keep my journal as usual then if he have doubt of my trust i shall show it to he with every thought of my heart put down for his dear eye to read i feel strangely sad and low spirited to day i suppose it be the reaction from the terrible excitement last night i go to bed when the man have go simply because they tell i to i do feel sleepy and i do feel full of devour anxiety i keep think over everything that have be ever since jonathan come to see i in london and it all seem like a horrible tragedy with fate press on relentlessly to some destine end everything that one do seem no matter how right it may be to bring on the very thing which be most to be deplore if i have go to whitby perhaps poor dear lucy would be with we now she have take to visit the churchyard till i come and if she have come there in the daytime with i she would have walk there in her sleep and if she have go there at night and asleep that monster could have destroy she as he do oh why do i ever go to whitby there now cry again i wonder what have come over i to day i must hide it from jonathan for if he know that i have be cry twice in one morning i who never cry on my own account and whom he have never cause to shed a tear the dear fellow would fret his heart out i shall put a bold face on and if i do feel weepy he shall never see it i suppose it be one of the lesson that we poor woman have to learn i can quite remember how i fall asleep last night i remember hear the sudden barking of the dog and a lot of queer sound like pray on a very tumultuous scale from renfield room which be somewhere under this and then there be silence over everything silence so profound that it startle i and i get up and look out of the window all be dark and silent the black shadow throw by the moonlight seem full of a silent mystery of their own not a thing seem to be stir but all to be grim and fix as death or fate so that a thin streak of white mist that creep with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house seem to have a sentience and a vitality of its own i think that the digression of my thought must have do i good for when i get back to bed i find a lethargy creep over i i lie awhile but could not quite sleep so i get out and look out of the window again the mist be spread and be now close up to the house so that i could see it lie thick against the wall as though it be steal up to the window the poor man be more loud than ever and though i could not distinguish a word he say i could in some way recognise in his tone some passionate entreaty on his part then there be the sound of a struggle and i know that the attendant be deal with he i be so frightened that i creep into bed and pull the clothe over my head put my finger in my ear i be not then a bit sleepy at least so i think but i must have fall asleep for except dream i do not remember anything until the morning when jonathan wake i i think that it take i an effort and a little time to realise where i be and that it be jonathan who be bend over i my dream be very peculiar and be almost typical of the way that wake thought become merge in or continue in dream i think that i be asleep and wait for jonathan to come back i be very anxious about he and i be powerless to act my foot and my hand and my brain be weight so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace and so i sleep uneasily and think then it begin to dawn upon i that the air be heavy and dank and cold i put back the clothe from my face and find to my surprise that all be dim around i the gas light which i have leave light for jonathan but turn down come only like a tiny red spark through the fog which have evidently grow thick and pour into the room then it occur to i that i have shut the window before i have come to bed i would have get out to make certain on the point but some leaden lethargy seem to chain my limb and even my will i lie still and endure that be all i close my eye but could still see through my eyelid it be wonderful what trick our dream play we and how conveniently we can imagine the mist grow thick and thick and i could see now how it come in for i could see it like smoke or with the white energy of boiling water pour in not through the window but through the joining of the door it get thick and thick till it seem as if it become concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room through the top of which i could see the light of the gas shin like a red eye thing begin to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column be now whirl in the room and through it all come the scriptural word a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night be it indeed some such spiritual guidance that be come to i in my sleep but the pillar be compose of both the day and the night guiding for the fire be in the red eye which at the thought get a new fascination for i till as i look the fire divide and seem to shine on i through the fog like two red eye such as lucy tell i of in her momentary mental wandering when on the cliff the die sunlight strike the window of mary church suddenly the horror burst upon i that it be thus that jonathan have see those awful woman grow into reality through the whirl mist in the moonlight and in my dream i must have faint for all become black darkness the last conscious effort which imagination make be to show i a livid white face bend over i out of the mist i must be careful of such dream for they would unseat one reason if there be too much of they i would get van helsing or seward to prescribe something for i which would make i sleep only that i fear to alarm they such a dream at the present time would become weave into their fear for i to night i shall strive hard to sleep naturally if i do not i shall to morrow night get they to give i a dose of chloral that can not hurt i for once and it will give i a good night sleep last night tire i more than if i have not sleep at all october night i sleep but do not dream i must have sleep soundly for i be not wake by jonathan come to bed but the sleep have not refresh i for to day i feel terribly weak and spiritless i spend all yesterday try to read or lie down dozing in the afternoon renfield ask if he might see i poor man he be very gentle and when i come away he kiss my hand and bade god bless i some way it affect i much i be cry when i think of he this be a new weakness of which i must be careful jonathan would be miserable if he know i have be cry he and the other be out until dinner time and they all come in tired i do what i could to brighten they up and i suppose that the effort do i good for i forgot how tired i be after dinner they send i to bed and all go off to smoke together as they say but i know that they want to tell each other of what have occur to each during the day i could see from jonathan manner that he have something important to communicate i be not so sleepy as i should have be so before they go i ask seward to give i a little opiate of some kind as i have not sleep well the night before he very kindly make i up a sleep draught which he give to i tell i that it would do i no harm as it be very mild i have take it and be wait for sleep which still keep aloof i hope i have not do wrong for as sleep begin to flirt with i a new fear come that i may have be foolish in thus deprive myself of the power of wake i might want it here come sleep good night,5670
20,CHAPTER 20,chapter xx harker october find thomas snelling in his house at bethnal green but unhappily he be not in a condition to remember anything the very prospect of beer which my expect coming have open to he have prove too much and he have begin too early on his expected debauch i learn however from his wife who seem a decent poor soul that he be only the assistant to smollet who of the two mate be the responsible person so off i drive to walworth and find joseph smollet at home and in his shirt sleeve take a late tea out of a saucer he be a decent intelligent fellow distinctly a good reliable type of workman and with a headpiece of his own he remember all about the incident of the box and from a wonderful eare notebook which he produce from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trouser and which have hieroglyphical entry in thick half obliterate pencil he give i the destination of the box there be he say six in the cartload which he take from carfax and leave at chicksand street mile end new town and another six which he deposit at jamaica lane bermondsey if then the count mean to scatter these ghastly refuge of his over london these place be choose at the first of delivery so that later he might distribute more fully the systematic manner in which this be do make i think that he could not mean to confine himself to two side of london he be now fix on the far east of the northern shore on the east of the southern shore and on the south the north and west be surely never mean to be leave out of his diabolical scheme let alone the city itself and the very heart of fashionable london in the south west and west i go back to smollet and ask he if he could tell we if any other box have be take from carfax he well you treat i wery have give he half a i tell yer all i know i heeard a man by the name of bloxam say four night ago in the be an ounds in pincher alley as ow he an his mate ad ad a rare dusty job in a old ouse at purfleet there ai a many such job as this ere an i thinkin that maybe sam bloxam could tell ye summut i ask if he could tell i where to find he i tell he that if he could get i the address it would be worth another half sovereign to he so he gulp down the rest of his tea and stand up say that he be go to begin the search then and there at the door he stop and look ere there ai no sense in i a keepin you ere i may find sam soon or i may but anyhow he ai like to be in a way to tell ye much to night sam be a rare one when he start on the booze if you can give i a envelope with a stamp on it and put yer address on it i find out where sam be to be find and post it ye to night but well be up arter i m soon in the mornin or maybe ye will ketch i m for sam get off main early never mind the booze the night afore this be all practical so one of the child go off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper and to keep the change when she come back i address the envelope and stamp it and when smollet have again faithfully promise to post the address when find i take my way to home we on the track anyhow i be tired to night and want sleep mina be fast asleep and look a little too pale her eye look as though she have be cry poor dear i no doubt it fret she to be keep in the dark and it may make she doubly anxious about i and the other but it be good as it be it be well to be disappoint and worry in such a way now than to have her nerve break the doctor be quite right to insist on she be keep out of this dreadful business i must be firm for on i this particular burden of silence must rest i shall not ever enter on the subject with she under any circumstance indeed it may not be a hard task after all she herself have become reticent on the subject and have not speak of the count or his doing ever since we tell she of our decision october long and try and exciting day by the first post i get my direct envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclose on which be write with a carpenter pencil in a sprawling sam bloxam korkrans poters cort bartel street walworth arsk for the depite i get the letter in bed and rise without wake mina she look heavy and sleepy and pale and far from well i determine not to wake she but that when i should return from this new search i would arrange for she go back to exeter i think she would be happy in our own home with her daily task to interest she than in be here amongst we and in ignorance i only see seward for a moment and tell he where i be off to promise to come back and tell the rest so soon as i should have find out anything i drive to walworth and find with some difficulty potter court smollet spelling mislead i as i ask for poter court instead of potter court however when i have find the court i have no difficulty in discover corcoran lodge house when i ask the man who come to the door for the depite he shake his head and say i dunno i there ai no such person ere i never eard of i m in all my bloomin day do believe there ai nobody of that kind livin ere or anywhere i take out smollet letter and as i read it it seem to i that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide i what be you i ask i the depity he answer i see at once that i be on the right track phonetic spelling have again mislead i a half crown tip put the deputy knowledge at my disposal and i learn that bloxam who have sleep off the remain of his beer on the previous night at corcoran have leave for his work at poplar at five that morning he could not tell i where the place of work be situate but he have a vague idea that it be some kind of a new fangle and with this slender clue i have to start for poplar it be twelve before i get any satisfactory hint of such a building and this i get at a coffee shop where some workman be have their dinner one of these suggest that there be be erect at cross angel street a new cold storage building and as this suit the condition of a new fangle i at once drive to it an interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman both of whom be appease with coin of the realm put i on the track of bloxam he be send for on my suggesting that i be willing to pay his day wage to his foreman for the privilege of ask he a few question on a private matter he be a smart enough fellow though rough of speech and bearing when i have promise to pay for his information and give he an earnest he tell i that he have make two journey between carfax and a house in piccadilly and have take from this house to the latter nine great heavy a horse and cart hire by he for this purpose i ask he if he could tell i the number of the house in piccadilly to which he well i forgit the number but it be only a few door from a big white church or somethink of the kind not long build it be a dusty old ouse too though to the dustiness of the ouse we tooke the bloomin box from how do you get into the house if they be both empty there be the old party what engage i a waitin in the ouse at purfleet he elpe i to lift the box and put they in the dray curse i but he be the strong chap i ever strike an he a old feller with a white moustache one that thin you would think he could throw a shadder how this phrase thrill through i why e take up be end o the box like they be pound of tea and i a puffin an a blowin afore i could up end mine anyhow an i no chicken neither how do you get into the house in piccadilly i ask he be there too he must a start off and get there afore i for when i rung of the bell he kem an open the door isself an elpe i to carry the box into the all the whole nine i ask yus there be five in the first load an four in the second it be main dry work an i do so well remember ow i get ome i interrupt be the box leave in the hall yus it be a big all an there be else in it i make one more attempt to further you do have any key never use no key nor nothink the old gent he open the door isself an shut it again when i druv off i do remember the last time but that be the beer and you can remember the number of the house no sir but ye need have no difficulty about that it a igh un with a stone front with a bow on it and igh step up to the door i know they step avin ad to carry the box up with three loafer what come round to earn a copper the old gent give they shillin an they seem they get so much they want more but e take one of they by the shoulder and be like to throw i m down the step till the lot of they go away cussin i think that with this description i could find the house so have pay my friend for his information i start off for piccadilly i have gain a new painful experience the count could it be evident handle the earth box himself if so time be precious for now he have achieve a certain amount of distribution he could by choose his own time complete the task unobserve at piccadilly circus i discharge my cab and walk westward beyond the junior constitutional i come across the house describe and be satisfied that this be the next of the lair arrange by dracula the house look as though it have be long untenanted the window be encrust with dust and the shutter be up all the framework be black with time and from the iron the paint have mostly scale away it be evident that up to lately there have be a large notice board in front of the balcony it have however be roughly tear away the upright which have support it still remain behind the rail of the balcony i see there be some loose board whose raw edge look white i would have give a good deal to have be able to see the notice board intact as it would perhaps have give some clue to the ownership of the house i remember my experience of the investigation and purchase of carfax and i could not but feel that if i could find the former owner there might be some mean of gain access to the house there be at present nothing to be learn from the piccadilly side and nothing could be do so i go round to the back to see if anything could be gather from this quarter the mew be active the piccadilly house be mostly in occupation i ask one or two of the groom and helper whom i see around if they could tell i anything about the empty house one of they say he have hear it have lately be take but he could say from whom he tell i however that up to very lately there have be a notice board of for sale up and that perhaps mitchell sons candy the house agent could tell i something as he think he remember see the name of that firm on the board i do not wish to seem too eager or to let my informant know or guess too much so thank he in the usual manner i stroll away it be now grow dusk and the autumn night be close in so i do not lose any time have learn the address of mitchell sons candy from a directory at the berkeley i be soon at their office in sackville street the gentleman who see i be particularly suave in manner but uncommunicative in equal proportion have once tell i that the piccadilly house which throughout our interview he call a sell he consider my business as conclude when i ask who have purchase it he open his eye a thought wider and pause a few second before it be sell sir pardon i i say with equal politeness but i have a special reason for wish to know who purchase it again he pause long and raise his eyebrow still more it be sell sir be again his laconic reply surely i say you do not mind let i know so much but i do mind he answer the affair of their client be absolutely safe in the hand of mitchell sons candy this be manifestly a prig of the first water and there be no use argue with he i think i have well meet he on his own ground so i your client sir be happy in have so resolute a guardian of their confidence i be myself a professional man here i hand he my card in this instance i be not prompt by curiosity i act on the part of lord godalming who wish to know something of the property which be he understand lately for sale these word put a different complexion on affair he i would like to oblige you if i could harker and especially would i like to oblige his lordship we once carry out a small matter of rent some chamber for he when he be the honourable arthur holmwood if you will let i have his lordship address i will consult the house on the subject and will in any case communicate with his lordship by to night post it will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rule as to give the require information to his lordship i want to secure a friend and not to make an enemy so i thank he give the address at seward and come away it be now dark and i be tired and hungry i get a cup of tea at the aërated bread company and come down to purfleet by the next train i find all the other at home mina be look tired and pale but she make a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful it wring my heart to think that i have have to keep anything from she and so cause her inquietude thank god this will be the last night of she look on at our conference and feel the sting of our not show our confidence it take all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keep she out of our grim task she seem somehow more reconcile or else the very subject seem to have become repugnant to she for when any accidental allusion be make she actually shudder i be glad we make our resolution in time as with such a feeling as this our grow knowledge would be torture to she i could not tell the other of the day discovery till we be alone so after dinner follow by a little music to save appearance even amongst ourselves i take mina to her room and leave she to go to bed the dear girl be more affectionate with i than ever and clung to i as though she would detain i but there be much to be talk of and i come away thank god the ceasing of tell thing have make no difference between we when i come down again i find the other all gather round the fire in the study in the train i have write my diary so far and simply read it off to they as the good mean of let they get abreast of my own information when i have finish van helsing this have be a great day work friend jonathan doubtless we be on the track of the miss box if we find they all in that house then our work be near the end but if there be some miss we must search until we find they then shall we make our final coup and hunt the wretch to his real death we all sit silent awhile and all at once morris say how be we go to get into that house we get into the other answer lord godalming quickly but art this be different we break house at carfax but we have night and a walled park to protect we it will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in piccadilly either by day or night i confess i do see how we be go to get in unless that agency duck can find we a key of some sort perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the morning lord godalming brow contract and he stand up and walk about the room by and by he stop and say turn from one to another of quincey head be level this burglary business be get serious we get off once all right but we have now a rare job on hand unless we can find the count key basket as nothing could well be do before morning and as it would be at least advisable to wait till lord godalming should hear from mitchell we decide not to take any active step before breakfast time for a good while we sit and smoke discuss the matter in its various light and bearing i take the opportunity of bring this diary right up to the moment i be very sleepy and shall go to bed just a line mina sleep soundly and her breathing be regular her forehead be pucker up into little wrinkle as though she think even in her sleep she be still too pale but do not look so haggard as she do this morning to morrow will i hope mend all this she will be herself at home in exeter oh but i be sleepy seward diary be puzzle afresh about renfield his mood change so rapidly that i find it difficult to keep touch of they and as they always mean something more than his own well being they form a more than interesting study this morning when i go to see he after his repulse of van helsing his manner be that of a man command destiny he be in fact command destiny subjectively he do not really care for any of the thing of mere earth he be in the cloud and look down on all the weakness and want of we poor mortal i think i would improve the occasion and learn something so i ask what about the fly these time he smile on i in quite a superior sort of way such a smile as would have become the face of malvolio as he answer the fly my dear sir have one striking feature its wing be typical of the aërial power of the psychic faculty the ancient do well when they typify the soul as a butterfly i think i would push his analogy to its utmost logically so i say oh it be a soul you be after now be it his madness foil his reason and a puzzled look spread over his face as shake his head with a decision which i have but seldom see in he he oh no oh no i want no soul life be all i want here he brighten up i be pretty indifferent about it at present life be all right i have all i want you must get a new patient doctor if you wish to study zoophagy this puzzle i a little so i draw he then you command life you be a god i suppose he smile with an ineffably benign superiority oh no far be it from i to arrogate to myself the attribute of the deity i be not even concerned in his especially spiritual doing if i may state my intellectual position i be so far as concern thing purely terrestrial somewhat in the position which enoch occupy spiritually this be a poser to i i could not at the moment recall enoch appositeness so i have to ask a simple question though i feel that by do so i be lower myself in the eye of the and why enoch because he walk with god i could not see the analogy but do not like to admit it so i hark back to what he have so you do care about life and you do want soul why not i put my question quickly and somewhat sternly on purpose to disconcert he the effort succeed for an instant he unconsciously relapse into his old servile manner bent low before i and actually fawn upon i as he i do want any soul indeed indeed i do i could use they if i have they they would be no manner of use to i i could eat they he suddenly stop and the old cunning look spread over his face like a wind sweep on the surface of the water and doctor as to life what be it after all when you get all you require and you know that you will never want that be all i have friend good friend like you doctor seward this be say with a leer of inexpressible cunning i know that i shall never lack the mean of life i think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he see some antagonism in i for he at once fall back on the last refuge of such as he a dogged silence after a short time i see that for the present it be useless to speak to he he be sulky and so i come away later in the day he send for i ordinarily i would not have come without special reason but just at present i be so interested in he that i would gladly make an effort besides i be glad to have anything to help to pass the time harker be out follow up clue and so be lord godalming and quincey van helsing sit in my study pore over the record prepare by the harkers he seem to think that by accurate knowledge of all detail he will light upon some clue he do not wish to be disturb in the work without cause i would have take he with i to see the patient only i think that after his last repulse he might not care to go again there be also another reason renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and i be alone i find he sit out in the middle of the floor on his stool a pose which be generally indicative of some mental energy on his part when i come in he say at once as though the question have be wait on his what about soul it be evident then that my surmise have be correct unconscious cerebration be do its work even with the lunatic i determine to have the matter out what about they yourself i ask he do not reply for a moment but look all round he and up and down as though he expect to find some inspiration for an answer i do want any soul he say in a feeble apologetic way the matter seem prey on his mind and so i determine to use it to be cruel only to be kind so i you like life and you want life oh yes but that be all right you need worry about that but i ask how be we to get the life without get the soul also this seem to puzzle he so i follow it a nice time you have some time when you fly out there with the soul of thousand of fly and spider and bird and cat buzz and twitter and miaue all round you you get their life you know and you must put up with their soul something seem to affect his imagination for he put his finger to his ear and shut his eye screw they up tightly just as a small boy do when his face be be soap there be something pathetic in it that touch i it also give i a lesson for it seem that before i be a child only a child though the feature be wear and the stubble on the jaw be white it be evident that he be undergo some process of mental disturbance and know how his past mood have interpret thing seemingly foreign to himself i think i would enter into his mind as well as i could and go with he the first step be to restore confidence so i ask he speak pretty loud so that he would hear i through his closed would you like some sugar to get your fly round again he seem to wake up all at once and shake his head with a laugh he not much fly be poor thing after all after a pause he add but i do want their soul buzz round i all the same or spider i go on blow spider what the use of spider there be anything in they to eat stop suddenly as though remind of a forbidden topic so so i think to myself this be the second time he have suddenly stop at the word drink what do it mean renfield seem himself aware of have make a lapse for he hurry on as though to distract my attention from i do take any stock at all in such matter rat and mouse and such small deer as shakespeare have it chicken feed of the larder they might be call i past all that sort of nonsense you might as well ask a man to eat molecule with a pair of chop stick as to try to interest i about the less carnivora when i know of what be before i i see i say you want big thing that you can make your tooth meet in how would you like to breakfast on elephant what ridiculous nonsense you be talk he be get too wide awake so i think i would press he hard i wonder i say reflectively what an elephant soul be like the effect i desire be obtain for he at once fall from his high horse and become a child again i do want an elephant soul or any soul at all he say for a few moment he sit despondently suddenly he jump to his foot with his eye blaze and all the sign of intense cerebral excitement to hell with you and your soul he shout why do you plague i about soul have i get enough to worry and pain and distract i already without thinking of soul he look so hostile that i think he be in for another homicidal fit so i blow my whistle the instant however that i do so he become calm and say forgive i doctor i forget myself you do not need any help i be so worried in my mind that i be apt to be irritable if you only know the problem i have to face and that i be work out you would pity and tolerate and pardon i pray do not put i in a strait waistcoat i want to think and i can not think freely when my body be confine i be sure you will understand he have evidently self control so when the attendant come i tell they not to mind and they withdraw renfield watch they go when the door be close he say with considerable dignity and seward you have be very considerate towards i believe i that i be very very grateful to you i think it well to leave he in this mood and so i come away there be certainly something to ponder over in this man state several point seem to make what the american interviewer call a story if one could only get they in proper order here they will not mention drinking fear the thought of be burden with the soul of anything have no dread of want life in the future despise the mean form of life altogether though he dread be haunt by their soul logically all these thing point one way he have assurance of some kind that he will acquire some high life he dread the consequence the burden of a soul then it be a human life he look to and the merciful god the count have be to he and there be some new scheme of terror afoot go after my round to van helsing and tell he my suspicion he grow very grave and after think the matter over for a while ask i to take he to renfield i do so as we come to the door we hear the lunatic within sing gaily as he use to do in the time which now seem so long ago when we enter we see with amazement that he have spread out his sugar as of old the fly lethargic with the autumn be begin to buzz into the room we try to make he talk of the subject of our previous conversation but he would not attend he go on with his singing just as though we have not be present he have get a scrap of paper and be fold it into a note book we have to come away as ignorant as we go in his be a curious case indeed we must watch he to night letter mitchell sons and candy to lord godalming october my lord we be at all time only too happy to meet your wish we beg with regard to the desire of your lordship express by harker on your behalf to supply the follow information concern the sale and purchase of no piccadilly the original vendor be the executor of the late archibald winter suffield the purchaser be a foreign nobleman count de ville who effect the purchase himself pay the purchase money in note over the counter if your lordship will pardon we use so vulgar an expression beyond this we know nothing whatever of he we be my lord your lordship humble servant sons seward diary place a man in the corridor last night and tell he to make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from renfield room and give he instruction that if there should be anything strange he be to call i after dinner when we have all gather round the fire in the study harker have go to bed we discuss the attempt and discovery of the day harker be the only one who have any result and we be in great hope that his clue may be an important one before go to bed i go round to the patient room and look in through the observation trap he be sleep soundly and his chest rise and fall with regular respiration this morning the man on duty report to i that a little after midnight he be restless and keep say his prayer somewhat loudly i ask he if that be all he reply that it be all he hear there be something about his manner so suspicious that i ask point blank if he have be asleep he deny sleep but admit to have doze for a while it be too bad that man can not be trust unless they be watch to day harker be out follow up his clue and art and quincey be look after horse godalming think that it will be well to have horse always in readiness for when we get the information which we seek there will be no time to lose we must sterilise all the import earth between sunrise and sunset we shall thus catch the count at his weak and without a refuge to fly to van helsing be off to the british museum look up some authority on ancient medicine the old physician take account of thing which their follower do not accept and the professor be search for witch and demon cure which may be useful later i sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in strait waistcoat have meet again we seem at last to be on the track and our work of to morrow may be the beginning of the end i wonder if renfield quiet have anything to do with this his mood have so follow the doing of the count that the come destruction of the monster may be carry to he in some subtle way if we could only get some hint as to what pass in his mind between the time of my argument with he to day and his resumption of fly catch it might afford we a valuable clue he be now seemingly quiet for a spell be that wild yell seem to come from his room the attendant come burst into my room and tell i that renfield have somehow meet with some accident he have hear he yell and when he go to he find he lie on his face on the floor all cover with blood i must go at once,5881
21,CHAPTER 21,chapter xxi seward i put down with exactness all that happen as well as i can remember it since last i make an entry not a detail that i can recall must be forget in all calmness i must proceed when i come to renfield room i find he lie on the floor on his left side in a glitter pool of blood when i go to move he it become at once apparent that he have receive some terrible injury there seem none of that unity of purpose between the part of the body which mark even lethargic sanity as the face be expose i could see that it be horribly bruise as though it have be beat against the floor indeed it be from the face wound that the pool of blood originate the attendant who be kneel beside the body say to i as we turn he i think sir his back be break see both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face be paralyse how such a thing could have happen puzzle the attendant beyond measure he seem quite bewilder and his brow be gather in as he i can understand the two thing he could mark his face like that by beat his own head on the ground i see a young woman do it once at the eversfield asylum before anyone could lay hand on she and i suppose he might have break his back by fall out of bed if he get in an awkward kink but for the life of i i can imagine how the two thing occur if his back be break he could beat his head and if his face be like that before the fall out of bed there would be mark of it i say to go to van helsing and ask he to kindly come here at once i want he without an instant delay the man run off and within a very few minute the professor in his dressing gown and slipper appear when he see renfield on the ground he look keenly at he a moment and then turn to i i think he recognize my thought in my eye for he say very quietly manifestly for the ear of the ah a sad accident he will need very careful watching and much attention i shall stay with you myself but i shall first dress myself if you will remain i shall in a few minute join you the patient be now breathe stertorously and it be easy to see that he have suffer some terrible injury van helsing return with extraordinary celerity bear with he a surgical case he have evidently be think and have his mind make up for almost before he look at the patient he whisper to send the attendant away we must be alone with he when he become conscious after the operation so i i think that will do now simmons we have do all that we can at present you have well go your round and van helsing will operate let i know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere the man withdraw and we go into a strict examination of the patient the wound of the face be superficial the real injury be a depressed fracture of the skull extend right up through the motor area the professor think a moment and we must reduce the pressure and get back to normal condition as far as can be the rapidity of the suffusion show the terrible nature of his injury the whole motor area seem affect the suffusion of the brain will increase quickly so we must trephine at once or it may be too late as he be speak there be a soft tapping at the door i go over and open it and find in the corridor without arthur and quincey in pyjama and slipper the former i hear your man call up van helsing and tell he of an accident so i wake quincey or rather call for he as he be not asleep thing be move too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of we these time i be think that to morrow night will not see thing as they have be we have to look back and forward a little more than we have do may we come in i nod and hold the door open till they have enter then i close it again when quincey see the attitude and state of the patient and note the horrible pool on the floor he say my god what have happen to he poor poor devil i tell he briefly and add that we expect he would recover consciousness after the operation for a short time at all event he go at once and sit down on the edge of the bed with godalming beside he we all watch in patience we shall wait say van helsing just long enough to fix the good spot for trephining so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot for it be evident that the hæmorrhage be increase the minute during which we wait pass with fearful slowness i have a horrible sinking in my heart and from van helsing face i gather that he feel some fear or apprehension as to what be to come i dread the word that renfield might speak i be positively afraid to think but the conviction of what be come be on i as i have read of man who have hear the death watch the poor man breathing come in uncertain gasp each instant he seem as though he would open his eye and speak but then would follow a prolong stertorous breath and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility inure as i be to sick bed and death this suspense grow and grow upon i i could almost hear the beating of my own heart and the blood surge through my temple sound like blow from a hammer the silence finally become agonising i look at my companion one after another and see from their flushed face and damp brow that they be endure equal torture there be a nervous suspense over we all as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it at last there come a time when it be evident that the patient be sink fast he might die at any moment i look up at the professor and catch his eye fix on mine his face be sternly set as he there be no time to lose his word may be worth many life i have be think so as i stand here it may be there be a soul at stake we shall operate just above the ear without another word he make the operation for a few moment the breathing continue to be stertorous then there come a breath so prolonged that it seem as though it would tear open his chest suddenly his eye open and become fix in a wild helpless stare this be continue for a few moment then it soften into a glad surprise and from the lip come a sigh of relief he move convulsively and as he do so i be quiet doctor tell they to take off the strait waistcoat i have have a terrible dream and it have leave i so weak that i can not move what wrong with my face it feel all swollen and it smart dreadfully he try to turn his head but even with the effort his eye seem to grow glassy again so i gently put it back then van helsing say in a quiet grave tell we your dream renfield as he hear the voice his face brighten through its mutilation and he that be van helsing how good it be of you to be here give i some water my lip be dry and i shall try to tell you i stop and seem faint i call quietly to brandy it be in my study quick he fly and return with a glass the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water we moisten the parch lip and the patient quickly revive it seem however that his poor injure brain have be work in the interval for when he be quite conscious he look at i piercingly with an agonise confusion which i shall never forget and i must not deceive myself it be no dream but all a grim reality then his eye rove round the room as they catch sight of the two figure sit patiently on the edge of the bed he go if i be not sure already i should know from they for an instant his eye close not with pain or sleep but voluntarily as though he be bring all his faculty to bear when he open they he say hurriedly and with more energy than he have yet quick doctor quick i be die i feel that i have but a few minute and then i must go back to death or bad wet my lip with brandy again i have something that i must say before i die or before my poor crush brain die anyhow thank you it be that night after you leave i when i implore you to let i go away i could speak then for i feel my tongue be tie but i be as sane then except in that way as i be now i be in an agony of despair for a long time after you leave i it seem hour then there come a sudden peace to i my brain seem to become cool again and i realize where i be i hear the dog bark behind our house but not where he be as he speak van helsing eye never blink but his hand come out and meet mine and grip it hard he do not however betray himself he nod slightly and say go on in a low voice renfield he come up to the window in the mist as i have see he often before but he be solid then not a ghost and his eye be fierce like a man when angry he be laugh with his red mouth the sharp white tooth glint in the moonlight when he turn to look back over the belt of tree to where the dog be bark i would ask he to come in at first though i know he want to just as he have want all along then he begin promise i thing not in word but by do they he be interrupt by a word from the how by make they happen just as he use to send in the fly when the sun be shin great big fat one with steel and sapphire on their wing and big moth in the night with skull and cross bone on their back van helsing nod to he as he whisper to i the acberontia atropos of the you call the head moth the patient go on without stop then he begin to whisper rat rat rat hundred thousand million of they and every one a life and dog to eat they and cat too all life all red blood with year of life in it and not merely buzz fly i laugh at he for i want to see what he could do then the dog howl away beyond the dark tree in his house he beckon i to the window i get up and look out and he raise his hand and seem to call out without use any word a dark mass spread over the grass come on like the shape of a flame of fire and then he move the mist to the right and leave and i could see that there be thousand of rat with their eye blaze red like his only small he hold up his hand and they all stop and i think he seem to be say all these life will i give you ay and many more and great through countless age if you will fall down and worship i and then a red cloud like the colour of blood seem to close over my eye and before i know what i be do i find myself open the sash and say to he come in lord and master the rat be all go but he slide into the room through the sash though it be only open an inch wide just as the moon herself have often come in through the tiny crack and have stand before i in all her size and splendour his voice be weak so i moisten his lip with the brandy again and he continue but it seem as though his memory have go on work in the interval for his story be far advanced i be about to call he back to the point but van helsing whisper to i let he go on do not interrupt he he can not go back and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lose the thread of his thought he all day i wait to hear from he but he do not send i anything not even a blow fly and when the moon get up i be pretty angry with he when he slide in through the window though it be shut and do not even knock i get mad with he he sneer at i and his white face look out of the mist with his red eye gleam and he go on as though he own the whole place and i be no one he do even smell the same as he go by i i could hold he i think that somehow harker have come into the room the two man sit on the bed stand up and come over stand behind he so that he could not see they but where they could hear well they be both silent but the professor start and quiver his face however grow grimmer and sterner still renfield go on without when harker come in to see i this afternoon she be the same it be like tea after the teapot have be water here we all move but no one say a word he go i do know that she be here till she speak and she do look the same i do care for the pale people i like they with lot of blood in they and hers have all seem to have run out i do think of it at the time but when she go away i begin to think and it make i mad to know that he have be take the life out of she i could feel that the rest quiver as i do but we remain otherwise still so when he come to night i be ready for he i see the mist steal in and i grab it tight i have hear that madman have unnatural strength and as i know i be a madman at time anyhow i resolve to use my power ay and he feel it too for he have to come out of the mist to struggle with i i hold tight and i think i be go to win for i do mean he to take any more of her life till i see his eye they burn into i and my strength become like water he slip through it and when i try to cling to he he raise i up and fling i down there be a red cloud before i and a noise like thunder and the mist seem to steal away under the door his voice be become fainter and his breath more stertorous van helsing stand up instinctively we know the bad now he say he be here and we know his purpose it may not be too late let we be arm the same as we be the other night but lose no time there be not an instant to spare there be no need to put our fear nay our conviction into word we share they in common we all hurry and take from our room the same thing that we have when we enter the count house the professor have his ready and as we meet in the corridor he point to they significantly as he they never leave i and they shall not till this unhappy business be over be wise also my friend it be no common enemy that we deal with alas alas that the dear madam mina should suffer he stop his voice be break and i do not know if rage or terror predominate in my own heart outside the harkers door we pause art and quincey hold back and the latter should we disturb she we must say van helsing grimly if the door be lock i shall break it in may it not frighten she terribly it be unusual to break into a lady room van helsing say you be always right but this be life and death all chamber be alike to the doctor and even be they not they be all as one to i to night friend john when i turn the handle if the door do not open do you put your shoulder down and shove and you too my friend now he turn the handle as he speak but the door do not yield we throw ourselves against it with a crash it burst open and we almost fall headlong into the room the professor do actually fall and i see across he as he gather himself up from hand and knee what i see appal i i feel my hair rise like bristle on the back of my neck and my heart seem to stand still the moonlight be so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room be light enough to see on the bed beside the window lie jonathan harker his face flush and breathe heavily as though in a stupor kneel on the near edge of the bed face outward be the white clothe figure of his wife by her side stand a tall thin man clothe in black his face be turn from we but the instant we see it we all recognise the count in every way even to the scar on his forehead with his left hand he hold both harker hand keep they away with her arm at full tension his right hand grip she by the back of the neck force her face down on his bosom her white nightdress be smear with blood and a thin stream trickle down the man bare breast which be show by his tear open dress the attitude of the two have a terrible resemblance to a child force a kitten nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink as we burst into the room the count turn his face and the hellish look that i have hear describe seem to leap into it his eye flame red with devilish passion the great nostril of the white aquiline nose open wide and quiver at the edge and the white sharp tooth behind the full lip of the blood dripping mouth champ together like those of a wild beast with a wrench which throw his victim back upon the bed as though hurl from a height he turn and spring at we but by this time the professor have gain his foot and be hold towards he the envelope which contain the sacred wafer the count suddenly stop just as poor lucy have do outside the tomb and cower back far and far back he cower as we lift our crucifix advance the moonlight suddenly fail as a great black cloud sail across the sky and when the gaslight spring up under quincey match we see nothing but a faint vapour this as we look trail under the door which with the recoil from its bursting open have swing back to its old position van helsing art and i move forward to harker who by this time have draw her breath and with it have give a scream so wild so ear pierce so despair that it seem to i now that it will ring in my ear till my die day for a few second she lie in her helpless attitude and disarray her face be ghastly with a pallor which be accentuate by the blood which smear her lip and cheek and chin from her throat trickle a thin stream of blood her eye be mad with terror then she put before her face her poor crush hand which bear on their whiteness the red mark of the count terrible grip and from behind they come a low desolate wail which make the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief van helsing step forward and draw the coverlet gently over her body whilst art after look at her face for an instant despairingly run out of the room van helsing whisper to jonathan be in a stupor such as we know the vampire can produce we can do nothing with poor madam mina for a few moment till she recover herself i must wake he he dip the end of a towel in cold water and with it begin to flick he on the face his wife all the while hold her face between her hand and sob in a way that be heart breaking to hear i raise the blind and look out of the window there be much moonshine and as i look i could see quincey morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yew tree it puzzle i to think why he be do this but at the instant i hear harker quick exclamation as he wake to partial consciousness and turn to the bed on his face as there might well be be a look of wild amazement he seem daze for a few second and then full consciousness seem to burst upon he all at once and he start up his wife be arouse by the quick movement and turn to he with her arm stretch out as though to embrace he instantly however she draw they in again and put she elbow together hold her hand before her face and shudder till the bed beneath her shook in god name what do this mean harker cry out seward van helsing what be it what have happen what be wrong mina dear what be it what do that blood mean my god my god have it come to this and raise himself to his knee he beat his hand wildly together good god help we help she oh help she with a quick movement he jump from the bed and begin to pull on his clothe all the man in he awake at the need for instant exertion what have happen tell i all about it he cry without pausing van helsing you love mina i know oh do something to save she it can not have go too far yet guard she while i look for he his wife through her terror and horror and distress see some sure danger to he instantly forget her own grief she seize hold of he and cry no no jonathan you must not leave i i have suffer enough to night god know without the dread of his harm you you must stay with i stay with these friend who will watch over you her expression become frantic as she speak and he yield to she she pull he down sit on the bedside and clung to he fiercely van helsing and i try to calm they both the professor hold up his little golden crucifix and say with wonderful do not fear my dear we be here and whilst this be close to you no foul thing can approach you be safe for to night and we must be calm and take counsel together she shudder and be silent hold down her head on her husband breast when she raise it his white night robe be stain with blood where her lip have touch and where the thin open wound in her neck have send forth drop the instant she see it she draw back with a low wail and whisper amidst choke unclean unclean i must touch he or kiss he no more oh that it should be that it be i who be now his bad enemy and whom he may have most cause to fear to this he speak out nonsense mina it be a shame to i to hear such a word i would not hear it of you and i shall not hear it from you may god judge i by my desert and punish i with more bitter suffering than even this hour if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between we he put out his arm and fold she to his breast and for a while she lie there sob he look at we over her bow head with eye that blink damply above his quivering nostril his mouth be set as steel after a while her sob become less frequent and more faint and then he say to i speak with a studied calmness which i feel try his nervous power to the and now seward tell i all about it too well i know the broad fact tell i all that have be i tell he exactly what have happen and he listen with seem impassiveness but his nostril twitch and his eye blaze as i tell how the ruthless hand of the count have hold his wife in that terrible and horrid position with her mouth to the open wound in his breast it interest i even at that moment to see that whilst the face of white set passion work convulsively over the bow head the hand tenderly and lovingly stroke the ruffled hair just as i have finish quincey and godalming knock at the door they enter in obedience to our summon van helsing look at i questioningly i understand he to mean if we be to take advantage of their come to divert if possible the thought of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves so on my nodding acquiescence to he he ask they what they have see or do to which lord godalming i could not see he anywhere in the passage or in any of our room i look in the study but though he have be there he have go he have he stop suddenly look at the poor drooping figure on the bed van helsing say go on friend arthur we want no more concealment our hope now be in know all tell freely so art go he have be there and though it could only have be for a few second he make rare hay of the place all the manuscript have be burn and the blue flame be flicker amongst the white ash the cylinder of your phonograph too be throw on the fire and the wax have help the flame here i interrupt thank god there be the other copy in the safe his face light for a moment but fall again as he go on i run downstairs then but could see no sign of he i look into renfield room but there be no trace there again he pause go on say harker hoarsely so he bow his head and moisten his lip with his tongue add except that the poor fellow be dead harker raise her head look from one to the other of we as she say god will be do i could not but feel that art be keep back something but as i take it that it be with a purpose i say nothing van helsing turn to morris and and you friend quincey have you any to tell a little he answer it may be much eventually but at present i can say i think it well to know if possible where the count would go when he leave the house i do not see he but i see a bat rise from renfield window and flap westward i expect to see he in some shape go back to carfax but he evidently seek some other lair he will not be back to night for the sky be redden in the east and the dawn be close we must work to morrow he say the latter word through his shut tooth for a space of perhaps a couple of minute there be silence and i could fancy that i could hear the sound of our heart beat then van helsing say place his hand very tenderly on harker and now madam mina poor dear dear madam mina tell we exactly what happen god know that i do not want that you be pain but it be need that we know all for now more than ever have all work to be do quick and sharp and in deadly earnest the day be close to we that must end all if it may so be and now be the chance that we may live and learn the poor dear lady shiver and i could see the tension of her nerve as she clasp her husband close to she and bent her head lower and low still on his breast then she raise her head proudly and hold out one hand to van helsing who take it in his and after stoop and kiss it reverently hold it fast the other hand be lock in that of her husband who hold his other arm throw round her protectingly after a pause in which she be evidently order her thought she i take the sleeping draught which you have so kindly give i but for a long time it do not act i seem to become more wakeful and myriad of horrible fancy begin to crowd in upon my mind all of they connect with death and vampire with blood and pain and trouble her husband involuntarily groan as she turn to he and say lovingly do not fret dear you must be brave and strong and help i through the horrible task if you only know what an effort it be to i to tell of this fearful thing at all you would understand how much i need your help well i see i must try to help the medicine do its work with my will if it be to do i any good so i resolutely set myself to sleep sure enough sleep must soon have come to i for i remember no more jonathan come in have not wake i for he lie by my side when next i remember there be in the room the same thin white mist that i have before notice but i forget now if you know of this you will find it in my diary which i shall show you later i feel the same vague terror which have come to i before and the same sense of some presence i turn to wake jonathan but find that he sleep so soundly that it seem as if it be he who have take the sleeping draught and not i try but could not wake he this cause i a great fear and i look around terrified then indeed my heart sink within i beside the bed as if he have step out of the mist or rather as if the mist have turn into his figure for it have entirely disappear stand a tall thin man all in black i know he at once from the description of the other the waxen face the high aquiline nose on which the light fall in a thin white line the part red lip with the sharp white tooth show between and the red eye that i have seem to see in the sunset on the window of mary church at whitby i know too the red scar on his forehead where jonathan have strike he for an instant my heart stand still and i would have scream out only that i be paralyse in the pause he speak in a sort of keen cut whisper point as he speak to silence if you make a sound i shall take he and dash his brain out before your very eye i be appal and be too bewildered to do or say anything with a mocking smile he place one hand upon my shoulder and hold i tight bar my throat with the other say as he do so first a little refreshment to reward my exertion you may as well be quiet it be not the first time or the second that your vein have appease my thirst i be bewilder and strangely enough i do not want to hinder he i suppose it be a part of the horrible curse that such be when his touch be on his victim and oh my god my god pity i he place his reeking lip upon my throat her husband groan again she clasp his hand hard and look at he pityingly as if he be the injured one and go i feel my strength fade away and i be in a half swoon how long this horrible thing last i know not but it seem that a long time must have pass before he take his foul awful sneer mouth away i see it drip with the fresh blood the remembrance seem for a while to overpower she and she droop and would have sink down but for her husband sustain arm with a great effort she recover herself and go then he speak to i mockingly and so you like the other would play your brain against mine you would help these man to hunt i and frustrate i in my design you know now and they know in part already and will know in full before long what it be to cross my path they should have keep their energy for use close to home whilst they play wit against i against i who command nation and intrigue for they and fight for they hundred of year before they be bear i be countermine they and you their well beloved one be now to i flesh of my flesh blood of my blood kin of my kin my bountiful wine press for a while and shall be later on my companion and my helper you shall be avenge in turn for not one of they but shall minister to your need but as yet you be to be punish for what you have do you have aid in thwart i now you shall come to my call when my brain say come to you you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding and to that end this with that he pull open his shirt and with his long sharp nail open a vein in his breast when the blood begin to spurt out he take my hand in one of his hold they tight and with the other seize my neck and press my mouth to the wound so that i must either suffocate or swallow some of the oh my god my god what have i do what have i do to deserve such a fate i who have try to walk in meekness and righteousness all my day god pity i look down on a poor soul in bad than mortal peril and in mercy pity those to whom she be dear then she begin to rub her lip as though to cleanse they from pollution as she be tell her terrible story the eastern sky begin to quicken and everything become more and more clear harker be still and quiet but over his face as the awful narrative go on come a grey look which deepen and deepen in the morning light till when the first red streak of the come dawn shoot up the flesh stand darkly out against the whiten hair we have arrange that one of we be to stay within call of the unhappy pair till we can meet together and arrange about take action of this i be sure the sun rise to day on no more miserable house in all the great round of its daily course,6177
22,CHAPTER 22,chapter xxii harker i must do something or go mad i write this diary it be now six and we be to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat for van helsing and seward be agree that if we do not eat we can not work our good our good will be god know require to day i must keep write at every chance for i dare not stop to think all big and little must go down perhaps at the end the little thing may teach we most the teaching big or little could not have land mina or i anywhere bad than we be to day however we must trust and hope poor mina tell i just now with the tear run down her dear cheek that it be in trouble and trial that our faith be test that we must keep on trusting and that god will aid we up to the end the end oh my god what end to work to work when van helsing and seward have come back from see poor renfield we go gravely into what be to be do first seward tell we that when he and van helsing have go down to the room below they have find renfield lie on the floor all in a heap his face be all bruise and crush in and the bone of the neck be break seward ask the attendant who be on duty in the passage if he have hear anything he say that he have be sit down he confess to half dozing when he hear loud voice in the room and then renfield have call out loudly several time god god god after that there be a sound of fall and when he enter the room he find he lie on the floor face down just as the doctor have see he van helsing ask if he have hear voice or a voice and he say he could not say that at first it have seem to he as if there be two but as there be no one in the room it could have be only one he could swear to it if require that the word god be speak by the patient seward say to we when we be alone that he do not wish to go into the matter the question of an inquest have to be consider and it would never do to put forward the truth as no one would believe it as it be he think that on the attendant evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in fall from bed in case the coroner should demand it there would be a formal inquest necessarily to the same result when the question begin to be discuss as to what should be our next step the very first thing we decide be that mina should be in full confidence that nothing of any sort no matter how painful should be keep from she she herself agree as to its wisdom and it be pitiful to see she so brave and yet so sorrowful and in such a depth of despair there must be no more concealment she say alas we have have too much already and besides there be nothing in all the world that can give i more pain than i have already endure than i suffer now whatever may happen it must be of new hope or of new courage to i van helsing be look at she fixedly as she speak and say suddenly but but dear madam mina be you not afraid not for yourself but for other from yourself after what have happen her face grow set in its line but her eye shine with the devotion of a martyr as she ah no for my mind be make up to what he ask gently whilst we be all very still for each in our own way we have a sort of vague idea of what she mean her answer come with direct simplicity as though she be simply state a because if i find in myself and i shall watch keenly for it a sign of harm to any that i love i shall die you would not kill yourself he ask hoarsely i would if there be no friend who love i who would save i such a pain and so desperate an effort she look at he meaningly as she speak he be sit down but now he rise and come close to she and put his hand on her head as he say my child there be such an one if it be for your good for myself i could hold it in my account with god to find such an euthanasia for you even at this moment if it be good nay be it safe but my for a moment he seem choke and a great sob rise in his throat he gulp it down and go there be here some who would stand between you and death you must not die you must not die by any hand but least of all by your own until the other who have foul your sweet life be true dead you must not die for if he be still with the quick un dead your death would make you even as he be no you must live you must struggle and strive to live though death would seem a boon unspeakable you must fight death himself though he come to you in pain or in joy by the day or the night in safety or in peril on your living soul i charge you that you do not die nay nor think of death till this great evil be past the poor dear grow white as death and shake and shiver as i have see a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide we be all silent we could do nothing at length she grow more calm and turn to he say sweetly but oh so sorrowfully as she hold out her i promise you my dear friend that if god will let i live i shall strive to do so till if it may be in his good time this horror may have pass away from i she be so good and brave that we all feel that our heart be strengthen to work and endure for she and we begin to discuss what we be to do i tell she that she be to have all the paper in the safe and all the paper or diary and phonograph we might hereafter use and be to keep the record as she have do before she be pleased with the prospect of anything to do if pleased could be use in connection with so grim an interest as usual van helsing have think ahead of everyone else and be prepare with an exact ordering of our work it be perhaps well he say that at our meeting after our visit to carfax we decide not to do anything with the earth box that lie there have we do so the count must have guess our purpose and would doubtless have take measure in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the other but now he do not know our intention nay more in all probability he do not know that such a power exist to we as can sterilize his lair so that he can not use they as of old we be now so much far advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that when we have examine the house in piccadilly we may track the very last of they to day then be ours and in it rest our hope the sun that rise on our sorrow this morning guard we in its course until it set to night that monster must retain whatever form he now have he be confine within the limitation of his earthly envelope he can not melt into thin air nor disappear through crack or chink or cranny if he go through a door way he must open the door like a mortal and so we have this day to hunt out all his lair and sterilize they so we shall if we have not yet catch he and destroy he drive he to bay in some place where the catching and the destroy shall be in time sure here i start up for i could not contain myself at the thought that the minute and second so preciously laden with mina life and happiness be fly from we since whilst we talk action be possible but van helsing hold up his hand warningly nay friend jonathan he say in this the quick way home be the long way so your proverb say we shall all act and act with desperate quick when the time have come but think in all probable the key of the situation be in that house in piccadilly the count may have many house which he have buy of they he will have deed of purchase key and other thing he will have paper that he write on he will have his book of cheque there be many belonging that he must have somewhere why not in this place so central so quiet where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour when in the very vast of the traffic there be none to notice we shall go there and search that house and when we learn what it hold then we do what our friend arthur call in his phrase of hunt stop the earth and so we run down our old fox so be it not then let we come at once i cry we be waste the precious precious time the professor do not move but simply and how be we to get into that house in piccadilly any way i cry we shall break in if need be and your police where will they be and what will they say i be stagger but i know that if he wish to delay he have a good reason for it so i say as quietly as i do wait more than need be you know i be sure what torture i be in ah my child that i do and indeed there be no wish of i to add to your anguish but just think what can we do until all the world be at movement then will come our time i have think and think and it seem to i that the simple way be the good of all now we wish to get into the house but we have no key be it not so i nod now suppose that you be in truth the owner of that house and could not still get it and think there be to you no conscience of the housebreaker what would you do i should get a respectable locksmith and set he to work to pick the lock for i and your police they would interfere would they not oh no not if they know the man be properly employ then he look at i keenly as he speak all that be in doubt be the conscience of the employer and the belief of your policeman as to whether or no that employer have a good conscience or a bad one your police must indeed be zealous man and clever oh so read the heart that they trouble themselves in such matter no no my friend jonathan you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your london or of any city in the world and if you do it as such thing be rightly do and at the time such thing be rightly do no one will interfere i have read of a gentleman who own a so fine house in your london and when he go for month of summer to zwitzerland and lock up his house some burglar come and break window at back and get in then he go and make open the shutter in front and walk out and in through the door before the very eye of the police then he have an auction in that house and advertise it and put up big notice and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the good of that other man who own they then he go to a builder and he sell he that house make an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time and your police and other authority help he all they can and when that owner come back from his holiday in zwitzerland he find only an empty hole where his house have be this be all do en règle and in our work we shall be en règle too we shall not go so early that the policeman who have then little to think of shall deem it strange but we shall go after ten when there be many about and when such thing would be do be we indeed owner of the house i could not but see how right he be and the terrible despair of mina face become relaxed a thought there be hope in such good counsel van helsing go when once within that house we may find more clue at any rate some of we can remain there whilst the rest find the other place where there be more earth box at bermondsey and mile end lord godalming stand up i can be of some use here he say i shall wire to my people to have horse and carriage where they will be most convenient look here old fellow say morris it be a capital idea to have all ready in case we want to go horsebacking but do you think that one of your snappy carriage with its heraldic adornment in a byeway at walworth or mile end would attract too much attention for our purpose it seem to i that we ought to take cab when we go south or east and even leave they somewhere near the neighbourhood we be go to friend quincey be right say the professor his head be what you call in plane with the horizon it be a difficult thing that we go to do and we do not want no people to watch we if so it may mina take a grow interest in everything and i be rejoice to see that the exigency of affair be help she to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night she be very very pale almost ghastly and so thin that her lip be draw away show her tooth in somewhat of prominence i do not mention this last lest it should give her needless pain but it make my blood run cold in my vein to think of what have occur with poor lucy when the count have suck her blood as yet there be no sign of the tooth grow sharper but the time as yet be short and there be time for fear when we come to the discussion of the sequence of our effort and of the disposition of our force there be new source of doubt it be finally agree that before start for piccadilly we should destroy the count lair close at hand in case he should find it out too soon we should thus be still ahead of he in our work of destruction and his presence in his purely material shape and at his weak might give we some new clue as to the disposal of force it be suggest by the professor that after our visit to carfax we should all enter the house in piccadilly that the two doctor and i should remain there whilst lord godalming and quincey find the lair at walworth and mile end and destroy they it be possible if not likely the professor urge that the count might appear in piccadilly during the day and that if so we might be able to cope with he then and there at any rate we might be able to follow he in force to this plan i strenuously object in so far as my going be concern for i say that i intend to stay and protect mina i think that my mind be make up on the subject but mina would not listen to my objection she say that there might be some law matter in which i could be useful that amongst the count paper might be some clue which i could understand out of my experience in transylvania and that as it be all the strength we could muster be require to cope with the count extraordinary power i have to give in for mina resolution be fix she say that it be the last hope for her that we should all work together as for i she say i have no fear thing have be as bad as they can be and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort go my husband god can if he wish it guard i as well alone as with any one present so i start up cry out then in god name let we come at once for we be lose time the count may come to piccadilly early than we think not so say van helsing hold up his hand but why i ask do you forget he say with actually a smile that last night he banquet heavily and will sleep late do i forget shall i ever can i ever can any of we ever forget that terrible scene mina struggle hard to keep her brave countenance but the pain overmaster she and she put her hand before her face and shudder whilst she moan van helsing have not intend to recall her frightful experience he have simply lose sight of she and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort when it strike he what he have say he be horrify at his thoughtlessness and try to comfort she oh madam mina he say dear dear madam mina alas that i of all who so reverence you should have say anything so forgetful these stupid old lip of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so but you will forget it will you not he bend low beside she as he speak she take his hand and look at he through her tear say no i shall not forget for it be well that i remember and with it i have so much in memory of you that be sweet that i take it all together now you must all be go soon breakfast be ready and we must all eat that we may be strong breakfast be a strange meal to we all we try to be cheerful and encourage each other and mina be the bright and most cheerful of we when it be over van helsing stand up and now my dear friend we go forth to our terrible enterprise be we all arm as we be on that night when first we visit our enemy lair arm against ghostly as well as carnal attack we all assure he then it be well now madam mina you be in any case quite safe here until the sunset and before then we shall return if we shall return but before we go let i see you armed against personal attack i have myself since you come down prepare your chamber by the placing of the thing of which we know so that he may not enter now let i guard yourself on your forehead i touch this piece of sacred wafer in the name of the father the son there be a fearful scream which almost freeze our heart to hear as he place the wafer on mina forehead it have sear it have burn into the flesh as though it have be a piece of white hot metal my poor darling brain tell she the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerve receive the pain of it and the two so overwhelm she that her overwrought nature have its voice in that dreadful scream but the word to her thought come quickly the echo of the scream have not cease to ring on the air when there come the reaction and she sink on her knee on the floor in an agony of abasement pull her beautiful hair over her face as the leper of old his mantle she wail unclean unclean even the almighty shun my polluted flesh i must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the judgment day they all pause i have throw myself beside she in an agony of helpless grief and put my arm around hold she tight for a few minute our sorrowful heart beat together whilst the friend around we turn away their eye that run tear silently then van helsing turn and say gravely so gravely that i could not help feel that he be in some way inspire and be state thing outside it may be that you may have to bear that mark till god himself see fit as he most surely shall on the judgment day to redress all wrong of the earth and of his child that he have place thereon and oh madam mina my dear my dear may we who love you be there to see when that red scar the sign of god knowledge of what have be shall pass away and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know for so surely as we live that scar shall pass away when god see right to lift the burden that be hard upon we till then we bear our cross as his son do in obedience to his will it may be that we be choose instrument of his good pleasure and that we ascend to his bidding as that other through stripe and shame through tear and blood through doubt and fear and all that make the difference between god and man there be hope in his word and comfort and they make for resignation mina and i both feel so and simultaneously we each take one of the old man hand and bend over and kiss it then without a word we all knelt down together and all hold hand swear to be true to each other we man pledge ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of she whom each in his own way we love and we pray for help and guidance in the terrible task which lie before we it be then time to start so i say farewell to mina a parting which neither of we shall forget to our die day and we set out to one thing i have make up my mind if we find out that mina must be a vampire in the end then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone i suppose it be thus that in old time one vampire mean many just as their hideous body could only rest in sacred earth so the holy love be the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly rank we enter carfax without trouble and find all thing the same as on the first occasion it be hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surrounding of neglect and dust and decay there be any ground for such fear as we already know have not our mind be make up and have there not be terrible memory to spur we on we could hardly have proceed with our task we find no paper nor any sign of use in the house and in the old chapel the great box look just as we have see they last van helsing say to we solemnly as we stand before and now my friend we have a duty here to do we must sterilise this earth so sacred of holy memory that he have bring from a far distant land for such fell use he have choose this earth because it have be holy thus we defeat he with his own weapon for we make it more holy still it be sanctify to such use of man now we sanctify it to god as he speak he take from his bag a screw driver and a wrench and very soon the top of one of the case be throw open the earth smell musty and close but we do not somehow seem to mind for our attention be concentrate on the professor take from his box a piece of the sacred wafer he lay it reverently on the earth and then shut down the lid begin to screw it home we aid he as he work one by one we treat in the same way each of the great box and leave they as we have find they to all appearance but in each be a portion of the host when we close the door behind we the professor say so much be already do if it may be that with all the other we can be so successful then the sunset of this evening may shine on madam mina forehead all white as ivory and with no stain as we pass across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum i look eagerly and in the window of my room see mina i wave my hand to she and nod to tell that our work there be successfully accomplish she nod in reply to show that she understand the last i see she be wave her hand in farewell it be with a heavy heart that we seek the station and just catch the train which be steam in as we reach the platform i have write this in the train piccadilly before we reach fenchurch street lord godalming say to i quincey and i will find a locksmith you have well not come with we in case there should be any difficulty for under the circumstance it would seem so bad for we to break into an empty house but you be a solicitor and the incorporated law society might tell you that you should have know well i demur as to my not share any danger even of odium but he go on besides it will attract less attention if there be not too many of we my title will make it all right with the locksmith and with any policeman that may come along you have well go with jack and the professor and stay in the green park somewhere in sight of the house and when you see the door open and the smith have go away do you all come across we shall be on the look out for you and will let you in the advice be good say van helsing so we say no more godalming and morris hurry off in a cab we follow in another at the corner of arlington street our contingent get out and stroll into the green park my heart beat as i see the house on which so much of our hope be centre loom up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and spruce look neighbour we sit down on a bench within good view and begin to smoke cigar so as to attract as little attention as possible the minute seem to pass with leaden foot as we wait for the coming of the other at length we see a four wheeler drive up out of it in leisurely fashion get lord godalming and morris and down from the box descend a thick set work man with his rush weave basket of tool morris pay the cabman who touch his hat and drive away together the two ascend the step and lord godalming point out what he want do the workman take off his coat leisurely and hang it on one of the spike of the rail say something to a policeman who just then saunter along the policeman nod acquiescence and the man kneel down place his bag beside he after search through it he take out a selection of tool which he proceed to lay beside he in orderly fashion then he stand up look into the keyhole blow into it and turn to his employer make some remark lord godalming smile and the man lift a good sized bunch of key select one of they he begin to probe the lock as if feel his way with it after fumble about for a bit he try a second and then a third all at once the door open under a slight push from he and he and the two other enter the hall we sit still my own cigar burn furiously but van helsing go cold altogether we wait patiently as we see the workman come out and take in his bag then he hold the door partly open steade it with his knee whilst he fit a key to the lock this he finally hand to lord godalming who take out his purse and give he something the man touch his hat take his bag put on his coat and depart not a soul take the slight notice of the whole transaction when the man have fairly go we three cross the street and knock at the door it be immediately open by quincey morris beside whom stand lord godalming light a cigar the place smell so vilely say the latter as we come in it do indeed smell vilely like the old chapel at carfax and with our previous experience it be plain to we that the count have be use the place pretty freely we move to explore the house all keep together in case of attack for we know we have a strong and wily enemy to deal with and as yet we do not know whether the count might not be in the house in the dining room which lie at the back of the hall we find eight box of earth eight box only out of the nine which we seek our work be not over and would never be until we should have find the missing box first we open the shutter of the window which look out across a narrow stone flagged yard at the blank face of a stable point to look like the front of a miniature house there be no window in it so we be not afraid of be overlook we do not lose any time in examine the chest with the tool which we have bring with we we open they one by one and treat they as we have treat those other in the chapel it be evident to we that the count be not at present in the house and we proceed to search for any of his effect after a cursory glance at the rest of the room from basement to attic we come to the conclusion that the dining room contain any effect which might belong to the count and so we proceed to minutely examine they they lie in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining room table there be title deed of the piccadilly house in a great bundle deed of the purchase of the house at mile end and bermondsey notepaper envelope and pen and ink all be cover up in thin wrapping paper to keep they from the dust there be also a clothe brush a brush and comb and a jug and basin the latter contain dirty water which be redden as if with blood last of all be a little heap of key of all sort and size probably those belong to the other house when we have examine this last find lord godalming and quincey morris take accurate note of the various address of the house in the east and the south take with they the key in a great bunch and set out to destroy the box in these place the rest of we be with what patience we can await their return or the coming of the count,5450
23,CHAPTER 23,chapter xxiii seward time seem terribly long whilst we be wait for the coming of godalming and quincey morris the professor try to keep our mind active by use they all the time i could see his beneficent purpose by the side glance which he throw from time to time at harker the poor fellow be overwhelmed in a misery that be appal to see last night he be a frank happy look man with strong youthful face full of energy and with dark brown hair to day he be a draw haggard old man whose white hair match well with the hollow burn eye and grief write line of his face his energy be still intact in fact he be like a live flame this may yet be his salvation for if all go well it will tide he over the despairing period he will then in a kind of way wake again to the reality of life poor fellow i think my own trouble be bad enough but the professor know this well enough and be do his good to keep his mind active what he have be say be under the circumstance of absorb interest as well as i can remember here it i have study over and over again since they come into my hand all the paper relate to this monster and the more i have study the great seem the necessity to utterly stamp he out all through there be sign of his advance not only of his power but of his knowledge of it as i learn from the research of my friend arminius of buda pesth he be in life a most wonderful man soldier statesman and alchemist which latter be the high development of the science knowledge of his time he have a mighty brain a learning beyond compare and a heart that know no fear and no remorse he dare even to attend the scholomance and there be no branch of knowledge of his time that he do not essay well in he the brain power survive the physical death though it would seem that memory be not all complete in some faculty of mind he have be and be only a child but he be grow and some thing that be childish at the first be now of man stature he be experiment and do it well and if it have not be that we have cross his path he would be yet he may be yet if we fail the father or furtherer of a new order of being whose road must lead through death not life harker groan and say and this be all array against my darling but how be he experiment the knowledge may help we to defeat he he have all along since his coming be try his power slowly but surely that big child brain of his be work well for we it be as yet a child brain for have he dare at the first to attempt certain thing he would long ago have be beyond our power however he mean to succeed and a man who have century before he can afford to wait and to go slow festina lente may well be his motto i fail to understand say harker wearily oh do be more plain to i perhaps grief and trouble be dull my brain the professor lay his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he ah my child i will be plain do you not see how of late this monster have be creep into knowledge experimentally how he have be make use of the zoophagous patient to effect his entry into friend john home for your vampire though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will must at the first make entry only when ask thereto by an inmate but these be not his most important experiment do we not see how at the first all these so great box be move by other he know not then but that must be so but all the time that so great child brain of his be grow and he begin to consider whether he might not himself move the box so he begin to help and then when he find that this be all right he try to move they all alone and so he progress and he scatter these graf of he and none but he know where they be hide he may have intend to bury they deep in the ground so that he only use they in the night or at such time as he can change his form they do he equal well and none may know these be his hiding place but my child do not despair this knowledge come to he just too late already all of his lair but one be sterilize as for he and before the sunset this shall be so then he have no place where he can move and hide i delay this morning that so we might be sure be there not more at stake for we than for he then why we not be even more careful than he by my clock it be one hour and already if all be well friend arthur and quincey be on their way to we to day be our day and we must go sure if slow and lose no chance see there be five of we when those absent one return whilst he be speak we be startle by a knock at the hall door the double postman knock of the telegraph boy we all move out to the hall with one impulse and van helsing hold up his hand to we to keep silence step to the door and open it the boy hand in a despatch the professor close the door again and after look at the direction open it and read it look out for he have just now come from carfax hurriedly and hasten towards the south he seem to be go the round and may want to see you mina there be a pause break by jonathan harker now god be thank we shall soon meet van helsing turn to he quickly and god will act in his own way and time do not fear and do not rejoice as yet for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoing i care for nothing now he answer hotly except to wipe out this brute from the face of creation i would sell my soul to do it oh hush hush my child say van helsing god do not purchase soul in this wise and the devil though he may purchase do not keep faith but god be merciful and just and know your pain and your devotion to that dear madam mina think you how her pain would be double do she but hear your wild word do not fear any of we we be all devoted to this cause and to day shall see the end the time be come for action to day this vampire be limit to the power of man and till sunset he may not change it will take he time to arrive here see it be twenty minute past one and there be yet some time before he can hither come be he never so quick what we must hope for be that my lord arthur and quincey arrive first about half an hour after we have receive harker telegram there come a quiet resolute knock at the hall door it be just an ordinary knock such as be give hourly by thousand of gentleman but it make the professor heart and mine beat loudly we look at each other and together move out into the hall we each hold ready to use our various armament the spiritual in the left hand the moral in the right van helsing pull back the latch and hold the door half open stand back have both hand ready for action the gladness of our heart must have show upon our face when on the step close to the door we see lord godalming and quincey morris they come quickly in and close the door behind they the former saying as they move along the it be all right we find both place six box in each and we destroy they all destroy ask the professor for he we be silent for a minute and then quincey there nothing to do but to wait here if however he do turn up by five we must start off for it will do to leave harker alone after sunset he will be here before long now say van helsing who have be consult his pocket book nota bene in madam telegram he go south from carfax that mean he go to cross the river and he could only do so at slack of tide which should be something before one that he go south have a meaning for we he be as yet only suspicious and he go from carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least you must have be at bermondsey only a short time before he that he be not here already show that he go to mile end next this take he some time for he would then have to be carry over the river in some way believe i my friend we shall not have long to wait now we should have ready some plan of attack so that we may throw away no chance hush there be no time now have all your arm be ready he hold up a warning hand as he speak for we all could hear a key softly insert in the lock of the hall door i could not but admire even at such a moment the way in which a dominant spirit assert itself in all our hunt party and adventure in different part of the world quincey morris have always be the one to arrange the plan of action and arthur and i have be accustom to obey he implicitly now the old habit seem to be renew instinctively with a swift glance round the room he at once lay out our plan of attack and without speak a word with a gesture place we each in position van helsing harker and i be just behind the door so that when it be open the professor could guard it whilst we two step between the incomer and the door godalme behind and quincey in front stand just out of sight ready to move in front of the window we wait in a suspence that make the second pass with nightmare slowness the slow careful step come along the hall the count be evidently prepare for some surprise at least he fear it suddenly with a single bound he leap into the room win a way past we before any of we could raise a hand to stay he there be something so panther like in the movement something so unhuman that it seem to sober we all from the shock of his coming the first to act be harker who with a quick movement throw himself before the door lead into the room in the front of the house as the count see we a horrible sort of snarl pass over his face show the eye tooth long and point but the evil smile as quickly pass into a cold stare of lion like disdain his expression again change as with a single impulse we all advance upon he it be a pity that we have not some well organise plan of attack for even at the moment i wonder what we be to do i do not myself know whether our lethal weapon would avail we anything harker evidently mean to try the matter for he have ready his great kukri knife and make a fierce and sudden cut at he the blow be a powerful one only the diabolical quickness of the count leap back save he a second less and the trenchant blade have shorn through his heart as it be the point just cut the cloth of his coat make a wide gap whence a bundle of bank note and a stream of gold fall out the expression of the count face be so hellish that for a moment i fear for harker though i see he throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke instinctively i move forward with a protective impulse hold the crucifix and wafer in my left hand i feel a mighty power fly along my arm and it be without surprise that i see the monster cower back before a similar movement make spontaneously by each one of we it would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity of anger and hellish rage which come over the count face his waxen hue become greenish yellow by the contrast of his burn eye and the red scar on the forehead show on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound the next instant with a sinuous dive he sweep under harker arm ere his blow could fall and grasp a handful of the money from the floor dash across the room and throw himself at the window amid the crash and glitter of the fall glass he tumble into the flagged area below through the sound of the shiver glass i could hear the ting of the gold as some of the sovereign fall on the flagging we run over and see he spring unhurt from the ground he rush up the step cross the flagged yard and push open the stable door there he turn and speak to you think to baffle i your pale face all in a row like sheep in a butcher you shall be sorry yet each one of you you think you have leave i without a place to rest but i have more my revenge be just begin i spread it over century and time be on my side your girl that you all love be mine already and through they you and other shall yet be mine my creature to do my bidding and to be my jackal when i want to feed bah with a contemptuous sneer he pass quickly through the door and we hear the rusty bolt creak as he fasten it behind he a door beyond open and shut the first of we to speak be the professor as realise the difficulty of follow he through the stable we move towards the hall we have learn something much notwithstanding his brave word he fear we he fear time he fear want for if not why he hurry so his very tone betray he or my ear deceive why take that money you follow quick you be hunter of wild beast and understand it so for i i make sure that nothing here may be of use to he if so that he return as he speak he put the money remain into his pocket take the title deed in the bundle as harker have leave they and sweep the remain thing into the open fireplace where he set fire to they with a match godalming and morris have rush out into the yard and harker have lower himself from the window to follow the count he have however bolt the stable door and by the time they have force it open there be no sign of he van helsing and i try to make inquiry at the back of the house but the mew be desert and no one have see he depart it be now late in the afternoon and sunset be not far off we have to recognise that our game be up with heavy heart we agree with the professor when he let we go back to madam mina poor poor dear madam mina all we can do just now be do and we can there at least protect she but we need not despair there be but one more earth box and we must try to find it when that be do all may yet be well i could see that he speak as bravely as he could to comfort harker the poor fellow be quite break down now and again he give a low groan which he could not suppress he be think of his wife with sad heart we come back to my house where we find harker await we with an appearance of cheerfulness which do honour to her bravery and unselfishness when she see our face her own become as pale as death for a second or two her eye be close as if she be in secret prayer and then she say i can never thank you all enough oh my poor darling as she speak she take her husband grey head in her hand and kiss your poor head here and rest it all will yet be well dear god will protect we if he so will it in his good intent the poor fellow only groan there be no place for word in his sublime misery we have a sort of perfunctory supper together and i think it cheer we all up somewhat it be perhaps the mere animal heat of food to hungry people for none of we have eat anything since breakfast or the sense of companionship may have help we but anyhow we be all less miserable and see the morrow as not altogether without hope true to our promise we tell harker everything which have pass and although she grow snowy white at time when danger have seem to threaten her husband and red at other when his devotion to she be manifest she listen bravely and with calmness when we come to the part where harker have rush at the count so recklessly she cling to her husband arm and hold it tight as though her clinging could protect he from any harm that might come she say nothing however till the narration be all do and matter have be bring right up to the present time then without let go her husband hand she stand up amongst we and speak oh that i could give any idea of the scene of that sweet sweet good good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation with the red scar on her forehead of which she be conscious and which we see with grind of our tooth remember whence and how it come her love kindness against our grim hate her tender faith against all our fear and doubting and we know that so far as symbol go she with all her goodness and purity and faith be outcast from god jonathan she say and the word sound like music on her lip it be so full of love and tenderness jonathan dear and you all my true true friend i want you to bear something in mind through all this dreadful time i know that you must fight that you must destroy even as you destroy the false lucy so that the true lucy might live hereafter but it be not a work of hate that poor soul who have work all this misery be the sad case of all just think what will be his joy when he too be destroy in his worse part that his well part may have spiritual immortality you must be pitiful to he too though it may not hold your hand from his destruction as she speak i could see her husband face darken and draw together as though the passion in he be shrivel his be to its core instinctively the clasp on his wife hand grow close till his knuckle look white she do not flinch from the pain which i know she must have suffer but look at he with eye that be more appealing than ever as she stop speak he leap to his foot almost tear his hand from hers as he may god give he into my hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of he which we be aim at if beyond it i could send his soul for ever and ever to burn hell i would do it oh hush oh hush in the name of the good god do say such thing jonathan my husband or you will crush i with fear and horror just think my dear i have be think all this long long day of it that perhaps some day i too may need such pity and that some other like you and with equal cause for anger may deny it to i oh my husband my husband indeed i would have spar you such a thought have there be another way but i pray that god may not have treasure your wild word except as the heartbroken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man oh god let these poor white hair go in evidence of what he have suffer who all his life have do no wrong and on whom so many sorrow have come we man be all in tear now there be no resist they and we weep openly she weep too to see that her sweet counsel have prevail her husband fling himself on his knee beside she and put his arm round she hide his face in the fold of her dress van helsing beckon to we and we steal out of the room leave the two love heart alone with god before they retire the professor fix up the room against any coming of the vampire and assure harker that she might rest in peace she try to school herself to the belief and manifestly for her husband sake try to seem content it be a brave struggle and be i think and believe not without its reward van helsing have place at hand a bell which either of they be to sound in case of any emergency when they have retire quincey godalming and i arrange that we should sit up divide the night between we and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady the first watch fall to quincey so the rest of we will be off to bed as soon as we can godalming have already turn in for his be the second watch now that my work be do i too shall go to bed jonathan harker journal october close to thought yesterday would never end there be over i a yearning for sleep in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find thing change and that any change must now be for the well before we part we discuss what our next step be to be but we could arrive at no result all we know be that one earth box remain and that the count alone know where it be if he choose to lie hide he may baffle we for year and in the thought be too horrible i dare not think of it even now this i know that if ever there be a woman who be all perfection that one be my poor wrong darling i love she a thousand time more for her sweet pity of last night a pity that make my own hate of the monster seem despicable surely god will not permit the world to be the poor by the loss of such a creature this be hope to i we be all drift reefward now and faith be our only anchor thank god mina be sleep and sleep without dream i fear what her dream might be like with such terrible memory to ground they in she have not be so calm within my seeing since the sunset then for a while there come over her face a repose which be like spring after the blast of march i think at the time that it be the softness of the red sunset on her face but somehow now i think it have a deep meaning i be not sleepy myself though i be weary weary to death however i must try to sleep for there be to morrow to think of and there be no rest for i until must have fall asleep for i be awaken by mina who be sit up in bed with a startled look on her face i could see easily for we do not leave the room in darkness she have place a warning hand over my mouth and now she whisper in my hush there be someone in the corridor i get up softly and cross the room gently open the door just outside stretch on a mattress lie morris wide awake he raise a warning hand for silence as he whisper to hush go back to bed it be all right one of we will be here all night we do mean to take any chance his look and gesture forbade discussion so i come back and tell mina she sigh and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor pale face as she put her arm round i and say oh thank god for good brave man with a sigh she sink back again to sleep i write this as i be not sleepy though i must try again october again during the night i be waken by mina this time we have all have a good sleep for the grey of the come dawn be make the window into sharp oblong and the gas flame be like a speck rather than a disc of light she say to i

before the dawn for i feel that then i can speak and speak freely be quick for the time be short without a word he motion she to sit up in bed look fixedly at she he commence to make pass in front of she from over the top of her head downward with each hand in turn mina gaze at he fixedly for a few minute during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer for i feel that some crisis be at hand gradually her eye close and she sit stock still only by the gentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she be alive the professor make a few more pass and then stop and i could see that his forehead be cover with great bead of perspiration mina open her eye but she do not seem the same woman there be a faraway look in her eye and her voice have a sad dreaminess which be new to i raise his hand to impose silence the professor motion i to bring the other in they come on tip toe close the door behind they and stand at the foot of the bed look on mina appear not to see they the stillness be break by van helsing voice speak in a low level tone which would not break the current of she where be you the answer come in a neutral i do not know sleep have no place it can call its own for several minute there be silence mina sit rigid and the professor stand star at she fixedly the rest of we hardly dare to breathe the room be grow light without take his eye from mina face van helsing motion i to pull up the blind i do so and the day seem just upon we a red streak shoot up and a rosy light seem to diffuse itself through the room on the instant the professor speak where be you now the answer come dreamily but with intention it be as though she be interpret something i have hear her use the same tone when read her shorthand note i do not know it be all strange to i what do you see i can see nothing it be all dark what do you hear i could detect the strain in the professor patient voice the lapping of water it be gurgle by and little wave leap i can hear they on the outside then you be on a ship we all look at each other try to glean something each from the other we be afraid to think the answer come oh yes what else do you hear the sound of man stamp overhead as they run about there be the creaking of a chain and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan fall into the ratchet what be you do i be still oh so still it be like death the voice fade away into a deep breath as of one sleep and the open eye close again by this time the sun have rise and we be all in the full light of day van helsing place his hand on mina shoulder and lay her head down softly on her pillow she lie like a sleep child for a few moment and then with a long sigh awake and star in wonder to see we all around she have i be talk in my sleep be all she say she seem however to know the situation without tell though she be eager to know what she have tell the professor repeat the conversation and she then there be not a moment to lose it may not be yet too late morris and lord godalming start for the door but the professor calm voice call they back stay my friend that ship wherever it be be weigh anchor whilst she speak there be many ship weigh anchor at the moment in your so great port of london which of they be it that you seek god be thank that we have once again a clue though whither it may lead we we know not we have be blind somewhat blind after the manner of man since when we can look back we see what we might have see look forward if we have be able to see what we might have see alas but that sentence be a puddle be it not we can know now what be in the count mind when he seize that money though jonathan so fierce knife put he in the danger that even he dread he mean escape hear i escape he see that with but one earth box leave and a pack of man follow like dog after a fox this london be no place for he he have take his last earth box on board a ship and he leave the land he think to escape but no we follow he tally ho as friend arthur would say when he put on his red frock our old fox be wily oh so wily and we must follow with wile i too be wily and i think his mind in a little while in meantime we may rest and in peace for there be water between we which he do not want to pass and which he could not if he would unless the ship be to touch the land and then only at full or slack tide see and the sun be just rose and all day to sunset be to we let we take bath and dress and have breakfast which we all need and which we can eat comfortable since he be not in the same land with we mina look at he appealingly as she but why need we seek he far when he be go away from we he take her hand and pat it as he ask i nothing as yet when we have breakfast then i answer all question he would say no more and we separate to dress after breakfast mina repeat her question he look at she gravely for a minute and then say because my dear dear madam mina now more than ever must we find he even if we have to follow he to the jaw of hell she grow pale as she ask why because he answer solemnly he can live for century and you be but mortal woman time be now to be dread since once he put that mark upon your throat i be just in time

shall win so sure as that god sit on high to watch over his child therefore be of much comfort till we return jonathan harker journal i read to mina van helsing message in the phonograph the poor girl brighten up considerably already the certainty that the count be out of the country have give she comfort and comfort be strength to she for my own part now that this horrible danger be not face to face with we it seem almost impossible to believe in it even my own terrible experience in castle dracula seem like a long forget dream here in the crisp autumn air in the bright alas how can i disbelieve in the midst of my thought my eye fall on the red scar on my poor darling white forehead whilst that last there can be no disbelief and afterwards the very memory of it will keep faith crystal clear mina and i fear to be idle so we have be over all the diary again and again somehow although the reality seem great each time the pain and the fear seem less there be something of a guide purpose manifest throughout which be comfort mina say that perhaps we be the instrument of ultimate good it may be i shall try to think as she do we have never speak to each other yet of the future it be well to wait till we see the professor and the other after their investigation the day be run by more quickly than i ever think a day could run for i again it be now three mina harker journal october meet for report present professor van helsing lord godalming seward quincey morris jonathan harker mina harker van helsing describe what step be take during the day to discover on what boat and whither bind count dracula make his as i know that he want to get back to transylvania i feel sure that he must go by the danube mouth or by somewhere in the black sea since by that way he come it be a dreary blank that be before we omne ignotum pro magnifico and so with heavy heart we start to find what ship leave for the black sea last night he be in sailing ship since madam mina tell of sail be set these not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the times and so we go by suggestion of my lord godalming to your lloyd where be note of all ship that sail however so small there we find that only one black sea bind ship go out with the tide she be the czarina catherine and she sail from doolittle wharf for varna and thence on to other part and up the danube soh say i this be the ship whereon be the count so off we go to doolittle wharf and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look big than the office from he we inquire of the going of the czarina catherine he swear much and he red face and loud of voice but he good fellow all the same and when quincey give he something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up and put it in a so small bag which he have hide deep in his clothing he still well fellow and humble servant to we he come with we and ask many man who be rough and hot these be well fellow too when they have be no more thirsty they say much of blood and bloom and of other which i comprehend not though i guess what they mean but nevertheless they tell we all thing which we want to know they make known to we among they how last afternoon at about five come a man so hurry a tall man thin and pale with high nose and tooth so white and eye that seem to be burn that he be all in black except that he have a hat of straw which suit not he or the time that he scatter his money in make quick inquiry as to what ship sail for the black sea and for where some take he to the office and then to the ship where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gang plank and ask that the captain come to he the captain come when tell that he will be pay well and though he swear much at the first he agree to term then the thin man go and some one tell he where horse and cart can be hire he go there and soon he come again himself drive cart on which be a great box this he himself lift down though it take several to put it on truck for the ship he give much talk to captain as to how and where his box be to be place but the captain like it not and swear at he in many tongue and tell he that if he like he can come and see where it shall be but he say no that he come not yet for that he have much to do whereupon the captain tell he that he have well be quick with blood for that his ship will leave the place of blood before the turn of the tide with blood then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon the captain swear again polyglot and the thin man make he bow and thank he and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing final the captain more red than ever and in more tongue tell he that he do want no frenchmen with bloom upon they and also with blood in his ship with blood on she also and so after ask where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship form he depart no one know where he go or bloomin well care as they say for they have something else to think of well with blood again for it soon become apparent to all that the czarina catherine would not sail as be expect a thin mist begin to creep up from the river and it grow and grow till soon a dense fog envelop the ship and all around she the captain swear polyglot very polyglot polyglot with bloom and blood but he could do nothing the water rise and rise and he begin to fear that he would lose the tide altogether he be in no friendly mood when just at full tide the thin man come up the gang plank again and ask to see where his box have be stow then the captain reply that he wish that he and his box old and with much bloom and blood be in hell but the thin man do not be offend and go down with the mate and see where it be place and come up and stand awhile on deck in fog he must have come off by himself for none notice he indeed they think not of he for soon the fog begin to melt away and all be clear again my friend of the thirst and the language that be of bloom and blood laugh as they tell how the captain swear exceed even his usual polyglot and be more than ever full of picturesque when on question other mariner who be in movement up and down the river that hour he find that few of they have see any of fog at all except where it lie round the wharf however the ship go out on the ebb tide and be doubtless by morning far down the river mouth she be by then when they tell we well out to sea and so my dear madam mina it be that we have to rest for a time for our enemy be on the sea with the fog at his command on his way to the danube mouth to sail a ship take time go she never so quick and when we start we go on land more quick and we meet he there our good hope be to come on he when in the box between sunrise and sunset for then he can make no struggle and we may deal with he as we should there be day for we in which we can make ready our plan we know all about where he go for we have see the owner of the ship who have show we invoice and all paper that can be the box we seek be to be land in varna and to be give to an agent one ristic who will there present his credential and so our merchant friend will have do his part when he ask if there be any wrong for that so he can telegraph and have inquiry make at varna we say no for what be to be do be not for police or of the custom it must be do by we alone and in our own way when van helsing have do speak i ask he if it be certain that the count have remain on board the ship he reply we have the good proof of that your own evidence when in the hypnotic trance this morning i ask he again if it be really necessary that they should pursue the count for oh i dread jonathan leave i and i know that he would surely go if the other go he answer in grow passion at first quietly as he go on however he grow more angry and more forceful till in the end we could not but see wherein be at least some of that personal dominance which make he so long a master amongst yes it be necessary necessary necessary for your sake in the first and then for the sake of humanity this monster have do much harm already in the narrow scope where he find himself and in the short time when as yet he be only as a body grope his so small measure in darkness and not know all this have i tell these other you my dear madam mina will learn it in the phonograph of my friend john or in that of your husband i have tell they how the measure of leave his own barren land barren of people and come to a new land where life of man teem till they be like the multitude of stand corn be the work of century be another of the un dead like he to try to do what he have do perhaps not all the century of the world that have be or that will be could aid he with this one all the force of nature that be occult and deep and strong must have work together in some wondrous way the very place where he have be alive un dead for all these century be full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world there be deep cavern and fissure that reach none know whither there have be volcano some of whose opening still send out water of strange property and gas that kill or make to vivify doubtless there be something magnetic or electric in some of these combination of occult force which work for physical life in strange way and in himself be from the first some great quality in a hard and warlike time he be celebrate that he have more iron nerve more subtle brain more braver heart than any man in he some vital principle have in strange way find their utmost and as his body keep strong and grow and thrive so his brain grow too all this without that diabolic aid which be surely to he for it have to yield to the power that come from and be symbolic of good and now this be what he be to we he have infect you oh forgive i my dear that i must say such but it be for good of you that i speak he infect you in such wise that even if he do no more you have only to live to live in your own old sweet way and so in time death which be of man common lot and with god sanction shall make you like to he this must not be we have swear together that it must not thus be we minister of god own wish that the world and man for whom his son die will not be give over to monster whose very existence would defame he he have allow we to redeem one soul already and we go out as the old knight of the cross to redeem more like they we shall travel towards the sunrise and like they if we fall we fall in good cause he pause and i but will not the count take his rebuff wisely since he have be drive from england will he not avoid it as a tiger do the village from which he have be hunt aha he say your simile of the tiger good for i and i shall adopt he your man eater as they of india call the tiger who have once taste blood of the human care no more for other prey but prowl unceasing till he get he this that we hunt from our village be a tiger too a man eater and he never cease to prowl nay in himself he be not one to retire and stay afar in his life his live life he go over the turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground he be beat back but do he stay no he come again and again and again look at his persistence and endurance with the child brain that be to he he have long since conceive the idea of come to a great city what do he do he find out the place of all the world most of promise for he then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task he find in patience just how be his strength and what be his power he study new tongue he learn new social life new environment of old way the politic the law the finance the science the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he be his glimpse that he have have whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire nay it help he to grow as to his brain for it all prove to he how right he be at the first in his surmise he have do this alone all alone from a ruin tomb in a forget land what more may he not do when the great world of thought be open to he he that can smile at death as we know he who can flourish in the midst of disease that kill off whole people oh if such an one be to come from god and not the devil what a force for good might he not be in this old world of our but we be pledge to set the world free our toil must be in silence and our effort all in secret for this enlightened age when man believe not even what they see the doubting of wise man would be his great strength it would be at once his sheath and his armour and his weapon to destroy we his enemy who be willing to peril even our own soul for the safety of one we love for the good of mankind and for the honour and glory of god after a general discussion it be determined that for to night nothing be definitely settle that we should all sleep on the fact and try to think out the proper conclusion to morrow at breakfast we be to meet again and after make our conclusion know to one another we shall decide on some definite course of action i feel a wonderful peace and rest to night it be as if some haunt presence be remove from i perhaps my surmise be not finish could not be for i catch sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead and i know that i be still unclean seward diary all rise early and i think that sleep do much for each and all of we when we meet at early breakfast there be more general cheerfulness than any of we have ever expect to experience again it be really wonderful how much resilience there be in human nature let any obstructing cause no matter what be remove in any way even by death and we fly back to first principle of hope and enjoyment more than once as we sit around the table my eye open in wonder whether the whole of the past day have not be a dream it be only when i catch sight of the red blotch on harker forehead that i be bring back to reality even now when i be gravely resolve the matter it be almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble be still existent even harker seem to lose sight of her trouble for whole spell it be only now and again when something recall it to her mind that she think of her terrible scar we be to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action i see only one immediate difficulty i know it by instinct rather than reason we shall all have to speak frankly and yet i fear that in some mysterious way poor harker tongue be tie i know that she form conclusion of her own and from all that have be i can guess how brilliant and how true they must be but she will not or can not give they utterance i have mention this to van helsing and he and i be to talk it over when we be alone i suppose it be some of that horrid poison which have get into her vein begin to work the count have his own purpose when he give she what van helsing call the vampire baptism of blood well there may be a poison that distil itself out of good thing in an age when the existence of ptomaine be a mystery we should not wonder at anything one thing i know that if my instinct be true regard poor harker silence then there be a terrible difficulty an unknown danger in the work before we the same power that compel her silence may compel her speech i dare not think far for so i should in my thought dishonour a noble woman van helsing be come to my study a little before the other i shall try to open the subject with he the professor come in we talk over the state of thing i could see that he have something on his mind which he want to say but feel some hesitancy about broach the subject after beat about the bush a little he say friend john there be something that you and i must talk of alone just at the first at any rate later we may have to take the other into our confidence then he stop so i wait he go madam mina our poor dear madam mina be change a cold shiver run through i to find my bad fear thus endorse van helsing with the sad experience of miss lucy we must this time be warn before thing go too far our task be now in reality more difficult than ever and this new trouble make every hour of the dire importance i can see the characteristic of the vampire come in her face it be now but very very slight but it be to be see if we have eye to notice without to prejudge her tooth be some sharp and at time her eye be more hard but these be not all there be to she the silence now often as so it be with miss lucy she do not speak even when she write that which she wish to be know later now my fear be this if it be that she can by our hypnotic trance tell what the count see and hear be it not more true that he who have hypnotise she first and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his should if he will compel her mind to disclose to he that which she know i nod acquiescence he go then what we must do be to prevent this we must keep she ignorant of our intent and so she can not tell what she know not this be a painful task oh so painful that it heartbreak i to think of but it must be when to day we meet i must tell she that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council but be simply guard by we he wipe his forehead which have break out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured i know that it would be some sort of comfort to he if i tell he that i also have come to the same conclusion for at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt i tell he and the effect be as i expect it be now close to the time of our general gathering van helsing have go away to prepare for the meeting and his painful part of it i really believe his purpose be to be able to pray alone the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief be experience by both van helsing and myself harker have send a message by her husband to say that she would not join we at present as she think it well that we should be free to discuss our movement without her presence to embarrass we the professor and i look at each other for an instant and somehow we both seem relieve for my own part i think that if harker realise the danger herself it be much pain as well as much danger avert under the circumstance we agree by a questioning look and answer with finger on lip to preserve silence of our suspicion until we should have be able to confer alone again we go at once into our plan of campaign van helsing roughly put the fact before we the czarina catherine leave the thames yesterday morning it will take she at the quick speed she have ever make at least three week to reach varna but we can travel overland to the same place in three day now if we allow for two day less for the ship voyage owe to such weather influence as we know that the count can bring to bear and if we allow a whole day and night for any delay which may occur to we then we have a margin of nearly two week thus in order to be quite safe we must leave here on at late then we shall at any rate be in varna a day before the ship arrive and able to make such preparation as may be necessary of course we shall all go armed arm against evil thing spiritual as well as physical here quincey morris i understand that the count come from a wolf country and it may be that he will get there before we i propose that we add winchesters to our armament i have a kind of belief in a winchester when there be any trouble of that sort around do you remember art when we have the pack after we at tobolsk what would we have give then for a repeater apiece good say van helsing winchester it shall be quincey head be level at all time but most so when there be to hunt though my metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolf be of danger to man in the meantime we can do nothing here and as i think that varna be not familiar to any of we why not go there more soon it be as long to wait here as there to night and to morrow we can get ready and then if all be well we four can set out on our journey we four say harker interrogatively look from one to another of we of course answer the professor quickly you must remain to take care of your so sweet wife harker be silent for a while and then say in a hollow let we talk of that part of it in the morning i want to consult with mina i think that now be the time for van helsing to warn he not to disclose our plan to she but he take no notice i look at he significantly and cough for answer he put his finger on his lip and turn away harker october some time after our meeting this morning i could not think the new phase of thing leave my mind in a state of wonder which allow no room for active thought mina determination not to take any part in the discussion set i think and as i could not argue the matter with she i could only guess i be as far as ever from a solution now the way the other receive it too puzzle i the last time we talk of the subject we agree that there be to be no more concealment of anything amongst we mina be sleep now calmly and sweetly like a little child her lip be curve and her face beam with happiness thank god there be such moment still for she strange it all be i sit watch mina happy sleep and come as near to be happy myself as i suppose i shall ever be as the evening draw on and the earth take its shadow from the sun sink lower the silence of the room grow more and more solemn to i all at once mina open her eye and look at i tenderly jonathan i want you to promise i something on your word of honour a promise make to i but make holily in god hearing and not to be break though i should go down on my knee and implore you with bitter tear quick you must make it to i at once mina i say a promise like that i can not make at once i may have no right to make it but dear one she say with such spiritual intensity that her eye be like pole star it be i who wish it and it be not for myself you can ask van helsing if i be not right if he disagree you may do as you will nay more if you all agree later you be absolve from the promise i promise i say and for a moment she look supremely happy though to i all happiness for she be deny by the red scar on her forehead she promise i that you will not tell i anything of the plan form for the campaign against the count not by word or inference or implication not at any time whilst this remain to i and she solemnly point to the scar i see that she be in earnest and say i promise and as i say it i feel that from that instant a door have be shut between we later have be bright and cheerful all the evening so much so that all the rest seem to take courage as if infect somewhat with her gaiety as a result even i myself feel as if the pall of gloom which weigh we down be somewhat lift we all retire early mina be now sleep like a little child it be a wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remain to she in the midst of her terrible trouble thank god for it for then at least she can forget her care perhaps her example may affect i as her gaiety do to night i shall try it oh for a dreamless sleep october surprise mina wake i early about the same time as yesterday and ask i to bring van helsing i think that it be another occasion for hypnotism and without question go for the professor he have evidently expect some such call for i find he dress in his room his door be ajar so that he could hear the opening of the door of our room he come at once as he pass into the room he ask mina if the other might come too no she say quite simply it will not be necessary you can tell they just as well i must go with you on your journey van helsing be as startled as i be after a moment pause he but why you must take i with you i be safe with you and you shall be safe too but why dear madam mina you know that your safety be our solemn duty we go into danger to which you be or may be more liable than any of we from from circumstance thing that have be he pause embarrassed as she reply she raise her finger and point to her i know that be why i must go i can tell you now whilst the sun be come up i may not be able again i know that when the count will i i must go i know that if he tell i to come in secret i must come by wile by any device to hoodwink even jonathan god see the look that she turn on i as she speak and if there be indeed a recording angel that look be note to her everlasting honour i could only clasp her hand i could not speak my emotion be too great for even the relief of tear she go you man be brave and strong you be strong in your number for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who have to guard alone besides i may be of service since you can hypnotise i and so learn that which even i myself do not know van helsing say very madam mina you be as always most wise you shall with we come and together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve when he have speak mina long spell of silence make i look at she she have fall back on her pillow asleep she do not even wake when i have pull up the blind and let in the sunlight which flood the room van helsing motion to i to come with he quietly we go to his room and within a minute lord godalming seward and morris be with we also he tell they what mina have say and go in the morning we shall leave for varna we have now to deal with a new factor madam mina oh but her soul be true it be to she an agony to tell we so much as she have do but it be most right and we be warn in time there must be no chance lose and in varna we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrive what shall we do exactly ask morris laconically the professor pause before we shall at the first board that ship then when we have identify the box we shall place a branch of the wild rise on it this we shall fasten for when it be there none can emerge so at least say the superstition and to superstition must we trust at the first it be man faith in the early and it have its root in faith still then when we get the opportunity that we seek when none be near to see we shall open the box and and all will be well i shall not wait for any opportunity say morris when i see the box i shall open it and destroy the monster though there be a thousand man look on and if i be to be wipe out for it the next moment i grasp his hand instinctively and find it as firm as a piece of steel i think he understand my look i hope he do good boy say van helsing brave boy quincey be all man god bless he for it my child believe i none of we shall lag behind or pause from any fear i do but say what we may do what we must do but indeed indeed we can not say what we shall do there be so many thing which may happen and their way and their end be so various that until the moment we may not say we shall all be arm in all way and when the time for the end have come our effort shall not be lack now let we to day put all our affair in order let all thing which touch on other dear to we and who on we depend be complete for none of we can tell what or when or how the end may be as for i my own affair be regulate and as i have nothing else to do i shall go make arrangement for the travel i shall have all ticket and so forth for our journey there be nothing further to be say and we part i shall now settle up all my affair of earth and be ready for whatever may come be all do my will be make and all complete mina if she survive be my sole heir if it should not be so then the other who have be so good to we will have remainder it be now draw towards the sunset mina uneasiness call my attention to it i be sure that there be something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal these occasion be become harrowing time for we all for each sunrise and sunset open up some new danger some new pain which however may in god will be mean to a good end i write all these thing in the diary since my darling must not hear they now but if it may be that she can see they again they shall be ready she be call to i,6279
25,CHAPTER 25,chapter xxv seward october harker have ask i to note this as he say he be hardly equal to the task and he want an exact record kept i think that none of we be surprised when we be ask to see harker a little before the time of sunset we have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset be to her time of peculiar freedom when her old self can be manif without any control force subdue or restrain she or incite she to action this mood or condition begin some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset and last till either the sun be high or whilst the cloud be still aglow with the ray stream above the horizon at first there be a sort of negative condition as if some tie be loosen and then the absolute freedom quickly follow when however the freedom cease the change back or relapse come quickly precede only by a spell of warning silence to night when we meet she be somewhat constrained and bear all the sign of an internal struggle i put it down myself to she make a violent effort at the early instant she could do so a very few minute however give her complete control of herself then motion her husband to sit beside she on the sofa where she be half recline she make the rest of we bring chair up close take her husband hand in hers she we be all here together in freedom for perhaps the last time i know dear i know that you will always be with i to the end this be to her husband whose hand have as we could see tighten upon her in the morning we go out upon our task and god alone know what may be in store for any of we you be go to be so good to i as to take i with you i know that all that brave earnest man can do for a poor weak woman whose soul perhaps be lose no no not yet but be at any rate at stake you will do but you must remember that i be not as you be there be a poison in my blood in my soul which may destroy i which must destroy i unless some relief come to we oh my friend you know as well as i do that my soul be at stake and though i know there be one way out for i you must not and i must not take it she look appealingly at we all in turn begin and end with her husband what be that way ask van helsing in a hoarse voice what be that way which we must not may not take that i may die now either by my own hand or that of another before the great evil be entirely wrought i know and you know that be i once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit even as you do my poor lucy be death or the fear of death the only thing that stand in the way i would not shrink to die here now amidst the friend who love i but death be not all i can not believe that to die in such a case when there be hope before we and a bitter task to be do be god will therefore i on my part give up here the certainty of eternal rest and go out into the dark where may be the black thing that the world or the nether world hold we be all silent for we know instinctively that this be only a prelude the face of the other be set and harker grow ashen grey perhaps he guess well than any of we what be come she this be what i can give into the hotch pot i could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she use in such a place and with all seriousness what will each of you give your life i know she go on quickly that be easy for brave man your life be god and you can give they back to he but what will you give to i she look again questioningly but this time avoid her husband face quincey seem to understand he nod and her face light up then i shall tell you plainly what i want for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between we now you must promise i one and all even you my beloved husband that should the time come you will kill i what be that time the voice be quincey but it be low and strained when you shall be convince that i be so changed that it be well that i die that i may live when i be thus dead in the flesh then you will without a moment delay drive a stake through i and cut off my head or do whatever else may be want to give i rest quincey be the first to rise after the pause he kneel down before she and take her hand in his said i only a rough fellow who have perhaps live as a man should to win such a distinction but i swear to you by all that i hold sacred and dear that should the time ever come i shall not flinch from the duty that you have set we and i promise you too that i shall make all certain for if i be only doubtful i shall take it that the time have come my true friend be all she could say amid her fast fall tear as bend over she kiss his hand i swear the same my dear madam mina say van helsing and i say lord godalming each of they in turn kneel to she to take the oath i follow myself then her husband turn to she wan eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdue the snowy whiteness of his hair and and must i too make such a promise oh my wife you too my dearest she say with infinite yearning of pity in her voice and eye you must not shrink you be nearest and dear and all the world to i our soul be knit into one for all life and all time think dear that there have be time when brave man have kill their wife and their womenkind to keep they from fall into the hand of the enemy their hand do not falter any the more because those that they love implore they to slay they it be man duty towards those whom they love in such time of sore trial and oh my dear if it be to be that i must meet death at any hand let it be at the hand of he that love i well van helsing i have not forget your mercy in poor lucy case to he who stop with a fly blush and change her he who have good right to give her peace if that time shall come again i look to you to make it a happy memory of my husband life that it be his love hand which set i free from the awful thrall upon i again i swear come the professor resonant voice harker smile positively smile as with a sigh of relief she lean back and and now one word of warning a warning which you must never forget this time if it ever come may come quickly and unexpectedly and in such case you must lose no time in use your opportunity at such a time i myself might be nay if the time ever come shall be league with your enemy against you one more request she become very solemn as she say this it be not vital and necessary like the other but i want you to do one thing for i if you will we all acquiesce but no one speak there be no need to i want you to read the burial service she be interrupt by a deep groan from her husband take his hand in her she hold it over her heart and continue you must read it over i some day whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of thing it will be a sweet thought to all or some of we you my dearest will i hope read it for then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever come what may but oh my dear one he plead death be afar off from you nay she say hold up a warning hand i be deep in death at this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lie heavy upon i oh my wife must i read it he say before he begin it would comfort i my husband be all she say and he begin to read when she have get the book ready how can i how could any one tell of that strange scene its solemnity its gloom its sadness its horror and withal its sweetness even a sceptic who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional would have be melt to the heart have he see that little group of love and devoted friend kneel round that stricken and sorrow lady or hear the tender passion of her husband voice as in tone so broken with emotion that often he have to pause he read the simple and beautiful service for the burial of the dead i i can not go on word and v voice f fail m i she be right in her instinct strange as it all be bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to we who feel its potent influence at the time it comfort we much and the silence which show harker come relapse from her freedom of soul do not seem so full of despair to any of we as we have dread jonathan harker journal october leave charing cross on the morning of the get to paris the same night and take the place secure for we in the orient express we travel night and day arrive here at about five lord godalming go to the consulate to see if any telegram have arrive for he whilst the rest of we come on to this hotel the odessus the journey may have have incident i be however too eager to get on to care for they until the czarina catherine come into port there will be no interest for i in anything in the wide world thank god mina be well and look to be get strong her colour be come back she sleep a great deal throughout the journey she sleep nearly all the time before sunrise and sunset however she be very wakeful and alert and it have become a habit for van helsing to hypnotise she at such time at first some effort be need and he have to make many pass but now she seem to yield at once as if by habit and scarcely any action be need he seem to have power at these particular moment to simply will and her thought obey he he always ask she what she can see and hear she answer to the nothing all be dark and to the i can hear the wave lap against the ship and the water rush by canvas and cordage strain and mast and yard creak the wind be high i can hear it in the shroud and the bow throw back the foam it be evident that the czarina catherine be still at sea hasten on her way to varna lord godalming have just return he have four telegram one each day since we start and all to the same effect that the czarina catherine have not be report to lloyd from anywhere he have arrange before leave london that his agent should send he every day a telegram say if the ship have be report he be to have a message even if she be not report so that he might be sure that there be a watch be keep at the other end of the wire we have dinner and go to bed early to morrow we be to see the vice consul and to arrange if we can about get on board the ship as soon as she arrive van helsing say that our chance will be to get on board between sunrise and sunset the count even if he take the form of a bat can not cross the run water of his own volition and so can not leave the ship as he dare not change to man form without suspicion which he evidently wish to avoid he must remain in the box if then we can come on board after sunrise he be at our mercy for we can open the box and make sure of he as we do of poor lucy before he wake what mercy he will get from we will not count for much we think that we shall not have much trouble with official or the seaman thank god this be the country where bribery can do anything and we be well supply with money we have only to make sure that the ship can not come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warn and we shall be safe judge moneybag will settle this case i think report still the same lap wave and rush water darkness and favour wind we be evidently in good time and when we hear of the czarina catherine we shall be ready as she must pass the dardanelles we be sure to have some report be pretty well fix now i think to welcome the count on his return from his tour godalming tell the shipper that he fancy that the box send aboard might contain something steal from a friend of his and get a half consent that he might open it at his own risk the owner give he a paper tell the captain to give he every facility in do whatever he choose on board the ship and also a similar authorisation to his agent at varna we have see the agent who be much impressed with godalming kindly manner to he and we be all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wish will be do we have already arrange what to do in case we get the box open if the count be there van helsing and seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart morris and godalming and i shall prevent interference even if we have to use the arm which we shall have ready the professor say that if we can so treat the count body it will soon after fall into dust in such case there would be no evidence against we in case any suspicion of murder be arouse but even if it be not we should stand or fall by our act and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of we and a rope for myself i should take the chance only too thankfully if it be to come we mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent we have arrange with certain official that the instant the czarina catherine be see we be to be inform by a special messenger whole week of wait daily telegram to godalming but only the same story not yet report mina morning and evening hypnotic answer be unvarie lap wave rush water and creak mast telegram october rufus smith lloyd london to lord godalming care of vice consul varna czarina catherine report this morning from dardanelles seward diary i miss my phonograph to write diary with a pen be irksome to i but van helsing say i must we be all wild with excitement to day when godalming get his telegram from lloyd i know now what man feel in battle when the call to action be hear harker alone of our party do not show any sign of emotion after all it be not strange that she do not for we take special care not to let she know anything about it and we all try not to show any excitement when we be in her presence in old day she would i be sure have notice no matter how we might have try to conceal it but in this way she be greatly change during the past three week the lethargy grow upon she and though she seem strong and well and be get back some of her colour van helsing and i be not satisfied we talk of she often we have not however say a word to the other it would break poor harker heart certainly his nerve if he know that we have even a suspicion on the subject van helsing examine he tell i her tooth very carefully whilst she be in the hypnotic condition for he say that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there be no active danger of a change in she if this change should come it would be necessary to take step we both know what those step would have to be though we do not mention our thought to each other we should neither of we shrink from the task awful though it be to contemplate euthanasia be an excellent and a comforting word i be grateful to whoever invent it it be only about hour sail from the dardanelles to here at the rate the czarina catherine have come from london she should therefore arrive some time in the morning but as she can not possibly get in before then we be all about to retire early we shall get up at one so as to be ready october news yet of the ship arrival harker hypnotic report this morning be the same as usual so it be possible that we may get news at any moment we man be all in a fever of excitement except harker who be calm his hand be as cold as ice and an hour ago i find he whet the edge of the great ghoorka knife which he now always carry with he it will be a bad look out for the count if the edge of that kúkri ever touch his throat drive by that stern ice cold hand van helsing and i be a little alarmed about harker to day about noon she get into a sort of lethargy which we do not like although we keep silent to the other we be neither of we happy about it she have be restless all the morning so that we be at first glad to know that she be sleep when however her husband mention casually that she be sleep so soundly that he could not wake she we go to her room to see for ourselves she be breathe naturally and look so well and peaceful that we agree that the sleep be well for she than anything else poor girl she have so much to forget that it be no wonder that sleep if it bring oblivion to she do she good opinion be justify for when after a refreshing sleep of some hour she wake up she seem bright and well than she have be for day at sunset she make the usual hypnotic report wherever he may be in the black sea the count be hurry to his destination to his doom i trust day and no tiding of the czarina catherine she ought to be here by now that she be still journey somewhere be apparent for harker hypnotic report at sunrise be still the same it be possible that the vessel may be lie by at time for fog some of the steamer which come in last evening report patch of fog both to north and south of the port we must continue our watching as the ship may now be signal any moment october strange no news yet of the ship we wait for harker report last night and this morning as usual lap wave and rush water though she add that the wave be very faint the telegram from london have be the same no further report van helsing be terribly anxious and tell i just now that he fear the count be escape we he add i do not like that lethargy of madam mina soul and memory can do strange thing during trance i be about to ask he more but harker just then come in and he hold up a warning hand we must try to night at sunset to make she speak more fully when in her hypnotic state rufus smith london to lord godalming care of vice consul varna czarina catherine report enter galatz at one to day seward diary the telegram come announce the arrival in galatz i do not think it be such a shock to any of we as might have be expect true we do not know whence or how or when the bolt would come but i think we all expect that something strange would happen the delay of arrival at varna make we individually satisfied that thing would not be just as we have expect we only wait to learn where the change would occur none the less however be it a surprise i suppose that nature work on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that thing will be as they ought to be not as we should know that they will be transcendentalism be a beacon to the angel even if it be a will wisp to man it be an odd experience and we all take it differently van helsing raise his hand over his head for a moment as though in remonstrance with the almighty but he say not a word and in a few second stand up with his face sternly set lord godalming grow very pale and sit breathe heavily i be myself half stunned and look in wonder at one after another quincey morris tighten his belt with that quick movement which i know so well in our old wandering day it mean action harker grow ghastly white so that the scar on her forehead seem to burn but she fold her hand meekly and look up in prayer harker smile actually smile the dark bitter smile of one who be without hope but at the same time his action belie his word for his hand instinctively seek the hilt of the great kukri knife and rest there when do the next train start for galatz say van helsing to we generally at to morrow morning we all star for the answer come from harker how on earth do you know say art you forget or perhaps you do not know though jonathan do and so do van helsing that i be the train fiend at home in exeter i always use to make up the time table so as to be helpful to my husband i find it so useful sometimes that i always make a study of the time table now i know that if anything be to take we to castle dracula we should go by galatz or at any rate through bucharest so i learn the time very carefully unhappily there be not many to learn as the only train to morrow leaf as i say wonderful woman murmur the professor can we get a special ask lord godalming van helsing shake his head i fear not this land be very different from yours or mine even if we do have a special it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train moreover we have something to prepare we must think now let we organize you friend arthur go to the train and get the ticket and arrange that all be ready for we to go in the morning do you friend jonathan go to the agent of the ship and get from he letter to the agent in galatz with authority to make search the ship just as it be here quincey morris you see the vice consul and get his aid with his fellow in galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth so that no time be lose when over the danube john will stay with madam mina and i and we shall consult for so if time be long you may be delay and it will not matter when the sun set since i be here with madam to make report and i say harker brightly and more like her old self than she have be for many a long day shall try to be of use in all way and shall think and write for you as i use to do something be shift from i in some strange way and i feel free than i have be of late the three young man look happy at the moment as they seem to realise the significance of her word but van helsing and i turn to each other meet each a grave and troubled glance we say nothing at the time however when the three man have go out to their task van helsing ask harker to look up the copy of the diary and find he the part of harker journal at the castle she go away to get it when the door be shut upon she he say to we mean the same speak out there be some change it be a hope that make i sick for it may deceive we quite so do you know why i ask she to get the manuscript no say i unless it be to get an opportunity of see i alone you be in part right friend john but only in part i want to tell you something and oh my friend i be take a great a terrible risk but i believe it be right in the moment when madam mina say those word that arrest both our understanding an inspiration come to i in the trance of three day ago the count send she his spirit to read her mind or more like he take she to see he in his earth box in the ship with water rushing just as it go free at rise and set of sun he learn then that we be here for she have more to tell in her open life with eye to see and ear to hear than he shut as he be in his coffin box now he make his most effort to escape we at present he want she not he be sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call but he cut she off take she as he can do out of his own power that so she come not to he ah there i have hope that our man brain that have be of man so long and that have not lose the grace of god will come high than his child brain that he in his tomb for century that grow not yet to our stature and that do only work selfish and therefore small here come madam mina not a word to she of her trance she know it not and it would overwhelm she and make despair just when we want all her hope all her courage when most we want all her great brain which be train like man brain but be of sweet woman and have a special power which the count give she and which he may not take away altogether though he think not so hush let i speak and you shall learn oh john my friend we be in awful strait i fear as i never fear before we can only trust the good god silence here she come i think that the professor be go to break down and have hysteric just as he have when lucy die but with a great effort he control himself and be at perfect nervous poise when harker trip into the room bright and happy look and in the doing of work seemingly forgetful of her misery as she come in she hand a number of sheet of typewrite to van helsing he look over they gravely his face brighten up as he read then hold the page between his finger and thumb he friend john to you with so much of experience already and you too dear madam mina that be young here be a lesson do not fear ever to think a half thought have be buzz often in my brain but i fear to let he loose his wing here now with more knowledge i go back to where that half think come from and i find that he be no half thought at all that he be a whole thought though so young that he be not yet strong to use his little wing nay like the ugly duck of my friend hans andersen he be no duck thought at all but a big swan think that sail nobly on big wing when the time come for he to try they see i read here what jonathan have that other of his race who in a later age again and again bring his force over the great river into turkey land who when he be beat back come again and again and again though he have to come alone from the bloody field where his troop be be slaughter since he know that he alone could ultimately triumph what do this tell we not much no the count child thought see nothing therefore he speak so free your man think see nothing my man think see nothing till just now no but there come another word from some one who speak without thought because she too know not what it mean what it might mean just as there be element which rest yet when in nature course they move on their way and they touch then pouf and there come a flash of light heaven wide that blind and kill and destroy some but that show up all earth below for league and league be it not so well i shall explain to begin have you ever study the philosophy of crime yes and no you john yes for it be a study of insanity you no madam mina for crime touch you not not but once still your mind work true and argue not a particulari ad universale there be this peculiarity in criminal it be so constant in all country and at all time that even police who know not much from philosophy come to know it empirically that it be that be to be empiric the criminal always work at one crime that be the true criminal who seem predestinate to crime and who will of none other this criminal have not full man brain he be clever and cunning and resourceful but he be not of man stature as to brain he be of child brain in much now this criminal of ours be predestinate to crime also he too have child brain and it be of the child to do what he have do the little bird the little fish the little animal learn not by principle but empirically and when he learn to do then there be to he the ground to start from to do more dos pou sto say archimedes give i a fulcrum and i shall move the world to do once be the fulcrum whereby child brain become man brain and until he have the purpose to do more he continue to do the same again every time just as he have do before oh my dear i see that your eye be open and that to you the lightning flash show all the league for harker begin to clap her hand and her eye sparkle he go now you shall speak tell we two dry man of science what you see with those so bright eye he take her hand and hold it whilst she speak his finger and thumb close on her pulse as i think instinctively and unconsciously as she the count be a criminal and of criminal type nordau and lombroso would so classify he and qua criminal he be of imperfectly form mind thus in a difficulty he have to seek resource in habit his past be a clue and the one page of it that we know and that from his own lip tell that once before when in what morris would call a tight place he go back to his own country from the land he have try to invade and thence without lose purpose prepare himself for a new effort he come again well equip for his work and win so he come to london to invade a new land he be beat and when all hope of success be lose and his existence in danger he flee back over the sea to his home just as formerly he have flee back over the danube from turkey land good good oh you so clever lady say van helsing enthusiastically as he stoop and kiss her hand a moment later he say to i as calmly as though we have be have a sick room seventy two only and in all this excitement i have hope turn to she again he say with keen but go on go on there be more to tell if you will be not afraid john and i know i do in any case and shall tell you if you be right speak without fear i will try to but you will forgive i if i seem egotistical nay fear not you must be egotist for it be of you that we think then as he be criminal he be selfish and as his intellect be small and his action be base on selfishness he confine himself to one purpose that purpose be remorseless as he flee back over the danube leave his force to be cut to piece so now he be intent on be safe careless of all so his own selfishness free my soul somewhat of the terrible power which he acquire over i on that dreadful night i feel it oh i feel it thank god for his great mercy my soul be free than it have be since that awful hour and all that haunt i be a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have use my knowledge for his end the professor stand he have so use your mind and by it he have leave we here in varna whilst the ship that carry he rush through envelop fog up to galatz where doubtless he have make preparation for escape from we but his child mind only see so far and it may be that as ever be in god providence the very thing that the evil doer most reckon on for his selfish good turn out to be his chief harm the hunter be take in his own snare as the great psalmist say for now that he think he be free from every trace of we all and that he have escape we with so many hour to he then his selfish child brain will whisper he to sleep he think too that as he cut himself off from know your mind there can be no knowledge of he to you there be where he fail that terrible baptism of blood which he give you make you free to go to he in spirit as you have as yet do in your time of freedom when the sun rise and set at such time you go by my volition and not by his and this power to good of you and other you have win from your suffering at his hand this be now all more precious that he know it not and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where we however be not all selfish and we believe that god be with we through all this blackness and these many dark hour we shall follow he and we shall not flinch even if we peril ourselves that we become like he friend john this have be a great hour and it have do much to advance we on our way you must be scribe and write he all down so that when the other return from their work you can give it to they then they shall know as we do and so i have write it whilst we wait their return and harker have write with her typewriter all since she bring the ms to we,6219
26,CHAPTER 26,chapter xxvi seward be write in the train from varna to galatz last night we all assemble a little before the time of sunset each of we have do his work as well as he could so far as thought and endeavour and opportunity go we be prepare for the whole of our journey and for our work when we get to galatz when the usual time come round harker prepare herself for her hypnotic effort and after a long and more strenuous effort on the part of van helsing than have be usually necessary she sink into the trance usually she speak on a hint but this time the professor have to ask her question and to ask they pretty resolutely before we could learn anything at last her answer i can see nothing we be still there be no wave lap but only a steady swirl of water softly run against the hawser i can hear man voice call near and far and the roll and creak of oar in the rowlock a gun be fire somewhere the echo of it seem far away there be tramp of foot overhead and rope and chain be drag along what be this there be a gleam of light i can feel the air blow upon i here she stop she have rise as if impulsively from where she lie on the sofa and raise both her hand palm upwards as if lift a weight van helsing and i look at each other with understanding quincey raise his eyebrow slightly and look at she intently whilst harker hand instinctively close round the hilt of his kúkri there be a long pause we all know that the time when she could speak be pass but we feel that it be useless to say anything suddenly she sit up and as she open her eye say would none of you like a cup of tea you must all be so tired we could only make she happy and so acquiesced she bustle off to get tea when she have go van helsing you see my friend he be close to land he have leave his earth chest but he have yet to get on shore in the night he may lie hide somewhere but if he be not carry on shore or if the ship do not touch it he can not achieve the land in such case he can if it be in the night change his form and can jump or fly on shore as he do at whitby but if the day come before he get on shore then unless he be carry he can not escape and if he be carry then the custom man may discover what the box contain thus in fine if he escape not on shore to night or before dawn there will be the whole day lose to he we may then arrive in time for if he escape not at night we shall come on he in daytime box up and at our mercy for he dare not be his true self awake and visible lest he be discover there be no more to be say so we wait in patience until the dawn at which time we might learn more from harker early this morning we listen with breathless anxiety for her response in her trance the hypnotic stage be even long in come than before and when it come the time remain until full sunrise be so short that we begin to despair van helsing seem to throw his whole soul into the effort at last in obedience to his will she make all be dark i hear lap water level with i and some creaking as of wood on wood she pause and the red sun shoot up we must wait till to night and so it be that we be travel towards galatz in an agony of expectation we be due to arrive between two and three in the morning but already at bucharest we be three hour late so we can not possibly get in till well after sun up thus we shall have two more hypnotic message from harker either or both may possibly throw more light on what be happen have come and go fortunately it come at a time when there be no distraction for have it occur whilst we be at a station we might not have secure the necessary calm and isolation harker yield to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning i be in fear that her power of read the count sensation may die away just when we want it most it seem to i that her imagination be begin to work whilst she have be in the trance hitherto she have confine herself to the simple of fact if this go on it may ultimately mislead we if i think that the count power over she would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought but i be afraid that it may not be so when she do speak her word be something be go out i can feel it pass i like a cold wind i can hear far off confused sound as of man talk in strange tongue fierce fall water and the howling of wolf she stop and a shudder run through she increase in intensity for a few second till at the end she shake as though in a palsy she say no more even in answer to the professor imperative questioning when she wake from the trance she be cold and exhaust and languid but her mind be all alert she could not remember anything but ask what she have say when she be tell she ponder over it deeply for a long time and in silence october be near galatz now and i may not have time to write later sunrise this morning be anxiously look for by we all know of the increase difficulty of procure the hypnotic trance van helsing begin his pass early than usual they produce no effect however until the regular time when she yield with a still great difficulty only a minute before the sun rise the professor lose no time in his questioning her answer come with equal all be dark i hear the water swirl by level with my ear and the creaking of wood on wood cattle low far off there be another sound a queer one she stop and grow white and whiter still go on go on speak i command you say van helsing in an agonized voice at the same time there be despair in his eye for the risen sun be redden even harker pale face she open her eye and we all start as she say sweetly and seemingly with the utmost oh professor why ask i to do what you know i can i do remember anything then see the look of amazement on our face she say turn from one to the other with a troubled what have i say what have i do i know nothing only that i be lie here half asleep and i hear you say go on speak i command you it seem so funny to hear you order i about as if i be a bad child oh madam mina he say sadly it be proof if proof be need of how i love and honour you when a word for your good speak more earnest than ever can seem so strange because it be to order she whom i be proud to obey the whistle be sound we be near galatz we be on fire with anxiety and eagerness mina harker journal morris take i to the hotel where our room have be order by telegraph he be the one who could well be spar since he do not speak any foreign language the force be distribute much as they have be at varna except that lord godalming go to the vice consul as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official we be in extreme hurry jonathan and the two doctor go to the shipping agent to learn particular of the arrival of the czarina catherine godalming have return the consul be away and the vice consul sick so the routine work have be attend to by a clerk he be very obliging and offer to do anything in his power jonathan harker journal nine van helsing seward and i call on messrs mackenzie steinkoff the agent of the london firm of hapgood they have receive a wire from london in answer to lord godalming telegraphed request ask they to show we any civility in their power they be more than kind and courteous and take we at once on board the czarina catherine which lie at anchor out in the river harbour there we see the captain donelson by name who tell we of his voyage he say that in all his life he have never have so favourable a run man he say but it make we afeare for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi some rare piece o ill luck so as to keep up the average it no canny to run frae london to the black sea wi a wind ahint ye as though the deil himself be blawin on yer sail for his ain purpose an a the time we could no speer a thing gin we be nigh a ship or a port or a headland a fog fall on we and travel wi us till when after it have lift and we look out the deil a thing could we see we run by gibraltar bein able to signal an till we come to the dardanelles and have to wait to get our permit to pass we never be within hail o aught at first i incline to slack off sail and beat about till the fog be lift but while i thocht that if the deil be minded to get we into the black sea quick he be like to do it whether we would or no if we have a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi the owner or no hurt to our traffic an the old mon who have serve his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to we for no hinderin he this mixture of simplicity and cunning of superstition and commercial reasoning arouse van helsing who mine friend that devil be more clever than he be think by some and he know when he meet his match the skipper be not displeased with the compliment and go when we get past the bosphorus the man begin to grumble some o they the roumanians come and ask i to heave overboard a big box which have be put on board by a queer lookin old man just before we have start frae london i have see they speer at the fellow and put out their twa finger when they see he to guard against the evil eye man but the supersteetion of foreigner be pairfectly rideeculous i send they aboot their business pretty quick but as just after a fog close in on we i feel a wee bit as they do anent something though i would say it be agin the big box well on we go and as the fog do let up for five day i joost let the wind carry we for if the deil want to get somewhere well he would fetch it up an if he do well we keep a sharp look out anyhow sure enuch we have a fair way and deep water all the time and two day ago when the mornin sun come through the fog we find ourselves just in the river opposite galatz the roumanians be wild and want i right or wrong to take out the box and fle it in the river i have to argy wi they aboot it wi a handspike an when the last o they rise off the deck wi his head in his hand i have convince they that evil eye or no evil eye the property and the trust of my owner be well in my hand than in the river danube they have mind ye take the box on the deck ready to fling in and as it be mark galatz via varna i thocht i let it lie till we discharge in the port an get rid athegither we do do much clearin that day an have to remain the nicht at anchor but in the mornin braw an airly an hour before sun up a man come aboord wi an order write to he from england to receive a box mark for one count dracula sure enuch the matter be one ready to his hand he have his paper a reet an glad i be to be rid o the dam thing for i be beginnin masel to feel uneasy at it if the deil do have any luggage aboord the ship i thinkin it be nane ither than that same what be the name of the man who take it ask van helsing with restrained eagerness i be tellin ye quick he answer and step down to his cabin produce a receipt sign immanuel hildesheim burgen strasse be the address we find out that this be all the captain know so with thank we come away we find hildesheim in his office a hebrew of rather the adelphi type with a nose like a sheep and a fez his argument be point with specie we do the punctuation and with a little bargaining he tell we what he know this turn out to be simple but important he have receive a letter from de ville of london tell he to receive if possible before sunrise so as to avoid custom a box which would arrive at galatz in the czarina catherine this he be to give in charge to a certain petrof skinsky who deal with slovaks who trade down the river to the port he have be pay for his work by an english bank note which have be duly cash for gold at the danube international bank when skinsky have come to he he have take he to the ship and hand over the box so as to save porterage that be all he know we then seek for skinsky but be unable to find he one of his neighbour who do not seem to bear he any affection say that he have go away two day before no one know whither this be corroborate by his landlord who have receive by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due in english money this have be between ten and eleven last night we be at a standstill again whilst we be talk one come run and breathlessly gasp out that the body of skinsky have be find inside the wall of the churchyard of peter and that the throat have be tear open as if by some wild animal those we have be speak with run off to see the horror the woman cry out this be the work of a slovak we hurry away lest we should have be in some way draw into the affair and so detain as we come home we could arrive at no definite conclusion we be all convince that the box be on its way by water to somewhere but where that might be we would have to discover with heavy heart we come home to the hotel to mina when we meet together the first thing be to consult as to take mina again into our confidence thing be get desperate and it be at least a chance though a hazardous one as a preliminary step i be release from my promise to she mina harker journal october be so tired and wear out and dispirit that there be nothing to be do till they have some rest so i ask they all to lie down for half an hour whilst i should enter everything up to the moment i feel so grateful to the man who invent the traveller typewriter and to morris for get this one for i i should have feel quite astray do the work if i have to write with a pen it be all do poor dear dear jonathan what he must have suffer what must he be suffer now he lie on the sofa hardly seem to breathe and his whole body appear in collapse his brow be knit his face be draw with pain poor fellow maybe he be think and i can see his face all wrinkle up with the concentration of his thought oh if i could only help at all i shall do what i can i have ask van helsing and he have get i all the paper that i have not yet see whilst they be rest i shall go over all carefully and perhaps i may arrive at some conclusion i shall try to follow the professor example and think without prejudice on the fact before i i do believe that under god providence i have make a discovery i shall get the map and look over they i be more than ever sure that i be right my new conclusion be ready so i shall get our party together and read it they can judge it it be well to be accurate and every minute be precious mina harker memorandum enter in her journal ground of dracula problem be to get back to his own place a he must be bring back by some one this be evident for have he power to move himself as he wish he could go either as man or wolf or bat or in some other way he evidently fear discovery or interference in the state of helplessness in which he must be confine as he be between dawn and sunset in his wooden box b how be he to be a process of exclusion may help we by road by rail by water by be endless difficulty especially in leave a city x there be people and people be curious and investigate a hint a surmise a doubt as to what might be in the box would destroy he y there be or there might be custom and octroi officer to pass z his pursuer might follow this be his great fear and in order to prevent his being betray he have repel so far as he can even his victim i by be no one in charge of the box it would have to take its chance of be delay and delay would be fatal with enemy on the track true he might escape at night but where would he be if leave in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to this be not what he intend and he do not mean to risk it by be the safe way in one respect but with most danger in another on the water he be powerless except at night even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolf but be he wreck the live water would engulf he helpless and he would indeed be lose he could have the vessel drive to land but if it be unfriendly land wherein he be not free to move his position would still be desperate we know from the record that he be on the water so what we have to do be to ascertain what water the first thing be to realise exactly what he have do as yet we may then get a light on what his later task be to be must differentiate between what he do in london as part of his general plan of action when he be press for moment and have to arrange as good he could secondly we must see as well as we can surmise it from the fact we know of what he have do here as to the first he evidently intend to arrive at galatz and send invoice to varna to deceive we lest we should ascertain his mean of exit from england his immediate and sole purpose then be to escape the proof of this be the letter of instruction send to immanuel hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise there be also the instruction to petrof skinsky this we must only guess at but there must have be some letter or message since skinsky come to hildesheim that so far his plan be successful we know the czarina catherine make a phenomenally quick journey so much so that captain donelson suspicion be arouse but his superstition unite with his canniness play the count game for he and he run with his favour wind through fog and all till he bring up blindfold at galatz that the count arrangement be well make have be prove hildesheim clear the box take it off and give it to skinsky skinsky take it and here we lose the trail we only know that the box be somewhere on the water move along the custom and the octroi if there be any have be avoid now we come to what the count must have do after his land at galatz the box be give to skinsky before sunrise at sunrise the count could appear in his own form here we ask why skinsky be choose at all to aid in the work in my husband diary skinsky be mention as deal with the slovaks who trade down the river to the port and the man remark that the murder be the work of a slovak show the general feeling against his class the count want isolation my surmise be this that in london the count decide to get back to his castle by water as the most safe and secret way he be bring from the castle by szgany and probably they deliver their cargo to slovaks who take the box to varna for there they be ship for london thus the count have knowledge of the person who could arrange this service when the box be on land before sunrise or after sunset he come out from his box meet skinsky and instruct he what to do as to arrange the carriage of the box up some river when this be do and he know that all be in train he blot out his trace as he think by murder his agent i have examine the map and find that the river most suitable for the slovaks to have ascend be either the pruth or the sereth i read in the typescript that in my trance i hear cow low and water swirling level with my ear and the creaking of wood the count in his box then be on a river in an open boat propel probably either by oar or pole for the bank be near and it be work against stream there would be no such sound if float down stream of course it may not be either the sereth or the pruth but we may possibly investigate far now of these two the pruth be the more easily navigate but the sereth be at fundu join by the bistritza which run up round the borgo pass the loop it make be manifestly as close to dracula castle as can be get by water mina harker journal continue when i have do reading jonathan take i in his arm and kiss i the other keep shake i by both hand and van helsing our dear madam mina be once more our teacher her eye have see where we be blind now we be on the track once again and this time we may succeed our enemy be at his most helpless and if we can come on he by day on the water our task will be over he have a start but he be powerless to hasten as he may not leave his box lest those who carry he may suspect for they to suspect would be to prompt they to throw he in the stream where he perish this he know and will not now man to our council of war for here and now we must plan what each and all shall do i shall get a steam launch and follow he say lord godalming and i horse to follow on the bank lest by chance he land say morris good say the professor both good but neither must go alone there must be force to overcome force if need be the slovak be strong and rough and he carry rude arm all the man smile for amongst they they carry a small arsenal say i have bring some winchester they be pretty handy in a crowd and there may be wolf the count if you remember take some other precaution he make some requisition on other that harker could not quite hear or understand we must be ready at all point seward i think i have well go with quincey we have be accustom to hunt together and we two well armed will be a match for whatever may come along you must not be alone art it may be necessary to fight the slovaks and a chance thrust for i do suppose these fellow carry gun would undo all our plan there must be no chance this time we shall not rest until the count head and body have be separate and we be sure that he can not re incarnate he look at jonathan as he speak and jonathan look at i i could see that the poor dear be tear about in his mind of course he want to be with i but then the boat service would most likely be the one which would destroy the the the vampire why do i hesitate to write the word he be silent awhile and during his silence van helsing friend jonathan this be to you for twice reason first because you be young and brave and can fight and all energy may be need at the last and again that it be your right to destroy he that which have work such woe to you and your be not afraid for madam mina she will be my care if i may i be old my leg be not so quick to run as once and i be not use to ride so long or to pursue as need be or to fight with lethal weapon but i can be of other service i can fight in other way and i can die if need be as well as young man now let i say that what i would be this while you my lord godalming and friend jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river and whilst john and quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be land i will take madam mina right into the heart of the enemy country whilst the old fox be tie in his box float on the run stream whence he can not escape to land where he dare not raise the lid of his coffin box lest his slovak carrier should in fear leave he to perish we shall go in the track where jonathan go from bistritz over the borgo and find our way to the castle of dracula here madam mina hypnotic power will surely help and we shall find our way all dark and unknown otherwise after the first sunrise when we near that fateful place there be much to be do and other place to be make sanctify so that that nest of viper be obliterate here jonathan interrupt he do you mean to say professor van helsing that you would bring mina in her sad case and taint as she be with that devil illness right into the jaw of his death trap not for the world not for heaven or hell he become almost speechless for a minute and then go do you know what the place be have you see that awful den of hellish infamy with the very moonlight alive with grisly shape and ever speck of dust that whirl in the wind a devouring monster in embryo have you feel the vampire lip upon your throat here he turn to i and as his eye light on my forehead he throw up his arm with a cry oh my god what have we do to have this terror upon we and he sink down on the sofa in a collapse of misery the professor voice as he speak in clear sweet tone which seem to vibrate in the air calm we oh my friend it be because i would save madam mina from that awful place that i would go god forbid that i should take she into that place there be work wild work to be do there that her eye may not see we man here all save jonathan have see with our own eye what be to be do before that place can be purify remember that we be in terrible strait if the count escape we this time and he be strong and subtle and cunning he may choose to sleep he for a century and then in time our dear take my come to he to keep he company and would be as those other that you jonathan see you have tell we of their gloating lip you hear their ribald laugh as they clutch the move bag that the count throw to they you shudder and well may it be forgive i that i make you so much pain but it be necessary my friend be it not a dire need for the which i be give if need be my life if it be that anyone go into that place to stay it be i who would have to go to keep they company do as you will say jonathan with a sob that shake he all over we be in the hand of god it do i good to see the way that these brave man work how can woman help love man when they be so earnest and so true and so brave and too it make i think of the wonderful power of money what can it not do when it be properly apply and what might it do when basely use i feel so thankful that lord godalming be rich and that both he and morris who also have plenty of money be willing to spend it so freely for if they do not our little expedition could not start either so promptly or so well equip as it will within another hour it be not three hour since it be arrange what part each of we be to do now lord godalming and jonathan have a lovely steam launch with steam up ready to start at a moment notice seward and morris have half a dozen beautiful horse well appoint we have all the map and appliance of various kind that can be have professor van helsing and i be to leave by the train to night for veresti where we be to get a carriage to drive to the borgo pass we be bring a good deal of ready money as we be to buy a carriage and horse we shall drive ourselves for we have no one whom we can trust in this matter the professor know something of a great many language so we shall get on all right we have all get arm even for i a large bore revolver jonathan would not be happy unless i be armed like the rest alas i can not carry one arm that the rest do the scar on my forehead forbid that dear van helsing comfort i by tell i that i be fully armed as there may be wolf the weather be get cold every hour and there be snow flurry which come and go as warning take all my courage to say good bye to my darling we may never meet again courage mina the professor be look at you keenly his look be a warning there must be no tear now unless it may be that god will let they fall in gladness jonathan harker journal october be write this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch lord godalming be fire up he be an experienced hand at the work as he have have for year a launch of his own on the thames and another on the norfolk broads regard our plan we finally decide that mina guess be correct and that if any waterway be choose for the count escape back to his castle the sereth and then the bistritza at its junction would be the one we take it that somewhere about the degree north latitude would be the place choose for cross the country between the river and the carpathians we have no fear in run at good speed up the river at night there be plenty of water and the bank be wide enough apart to make steaming even in the dark easy enough lord godalming tell i to sleep for a while as it be enough for the present for one to be on watch but i can not sleep how can i with the terrible danger hang over my darling and she go out into that awful place my only comfort be that we be in the hand of god only for that faith it would be easy to die than to live and so be quit of all the trouble morris and seward be off on their long ride before we start they be to keep up the right bank far enough off to get on high land where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curve they have for the first stage two man to ride and lead their spare horse four in all so as not to excite curiosity when they dismiss the man which will be shortly they will themselves look after the horse it may be necessary for we to join force if so they can mount our whole party one of the saddle have a movable horn and can be easily adapt for mina if require it be a wild adventure we be on here as we be rush along through the darkness with the cold from the river seem to rise up and strike we with all the mysterious voice of the night around we it all come home we seem to be drift into unknown place and unknown way into a whole world of dark and dreadful thing godalming be shut the furnace door hurry along the day have come and godalming be sleep i be on watch the morning be bitterly cold the furnace heat be grateful though we have heavy fur coat as yet we have pass only a few open boat but none of they have on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek the man be scar every time we turn our electric lamp on they and fall on their knee and pray november news all day we have find nothing of the kind we seek we have now pass into the bistritza and if we be wrong in our surmise our chance be go we have overhaul every boat big and little early this morning one crew take we for a government boat and treat we accordingly we see in this a way of smooth matter so at fundu where the bistritza run into the sereth we get a roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously with every boat which we have overhaul since then this trick have succeed we have have every deference show to we and not once any objection to whatever we choose to ask or do some of the slovaks tell we that a big boat pass they go at more than usual speed as she have a double crew on board this be before they come to fundu so they could not tell we whether the boat turn into the bistritza or continue on up the sereth at fundu we could not hear of any such boat so she must have pass there in the night i be feel very sleepy the cold be perhaps begin to tell upon i and nature must have rest some time godalming insist that he shall keep the first watch god bless he for all his goodness to poor dear mina and i november be broad daylight that good fellow would not wake i he say it would have be a sin to for i sleep so peacefully and be forget my trouble it seem brutally selfish of i to have sleep so long and let he watch all night but he be quite right i be a new man this morning and as i sit here and watch he sleep i can do all that be necessary both as to mind the engine steering and keep watch i can feel that my strength and energy be come back to i i wonder where mina be now and van helsing they should have get to veresti about noon on wednesday it would take they some time to get the carriage and horse so if they have start and travel hard they would be about now at the borgo pass god guide and help they i be afraid to think what may happen if we could only go fast but we can not the engine be throb and do their utmost i wonder how seward and morris be get on there seem to be endless stream run down from the mountain into this river but as none of they be very large at present at all event though they be terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow melt the horseman may not have meet much obstruction i hope that before we get to strasba we may see they for if by that time we have not overtake the count it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next seward diary day on the road no news and no time to write it if there have be for every moment be precious we have have only the rest needful for the horse but we be both bear it wonderfully those adventurous day of our be turn up useful we must push on we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again hear at fundu that the launch have go up the bistritza i wish it be so cold there be sign of snow come and if it fall heavy it will stop we in such case we must get a sledge and go on russian fashion day we hear of the launch have be detain by an accident when try to force a way up the rapid the slovak boat get up all right by aid of a rope and steer with knowledge some go up only a few hour before godalming be an amateur fitter himself and evidently it be he who put the launch in trim again finally they get up the rapid all right with local help and be off on the chase afresh i fear that the boat be not any well for the accident the peasantry tell we that after she get upon the smooth water again she keep stop every now and again so long as she be in sight we must push on hard than ever our help may be want soon mina harker journal at veresti at noon the professor tell i that this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotize i at all and that all i could say be dark and quiet he be off now buy a carriage and horse he say that he will later on try to buy additional horse so that we may be able to change they on the way we have something more than mile before we the country be lovely and most interesting if only it be under different condition how delightful it would be to see it all if jonathan and i be drive through it alone what a pleasure it would be to stop and see people and learn something of their life and to fill our mind and memory with all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild beautiful country and the quaint people but van helsing have return he have get the carriage and horse we be to have some dinner and to start in an hour the landlady be put we up a huge basket of provision it seem enough for a company of soldier the professor encourage she and whisper to i that it may be a week before we can get any good food again he have be shop too and have send home such a wonderful lot of fur coat and wrap and all sort of warm thing there will not be any chance of our be cold we shall soon be off i be afraid to think what may happen to we we be truly in the hand of god he alone know what may be and i pray he with all the strength of my sad and humble soul that he will watch over my beloved husband that whatever may happen jonathan may know that i love he and honour he more than i can say and that my late and true thought will be always for he,7093
27,CHAPTER 27,chapter xxvii harker day long we have travel and at a good speed the horse seem to know that they be be kindly treat for they go willingly their full stage at good speed we have now have so many change and find the same thing so constantly that we be encourage to think that the journey will be an easy one van helsing be laconic he tell the farmer that he be hurry to bistritz and pay they well to make the exchange of horse we get hot soup or coffee or tea and off we go it be a lovely country full of beauty of all imaginable kind and the people be brave and strong and simple and seem full of nice quality they be very very superstitious in the first house where we stop when the woman who serve we see the scar on my forehead she cross herself and put out two finger towards i to keep off the evil eye i believe they go to the trouble of put an extra amount of garlic into our food and i can abide garlic ever since then i have take care not to take off my hat or veil and so have escape their suspicion we be travel fast and as we have no driver with we to carry tale we go ahead of scandal but i daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind we all the way the professor seem tireless all day he would not take any rest though he make i sleep for a long spell at sunset time he hypnotize i and he say that i answer as usual darkness lap water and creak wood so our enemy be still on the river i be afraid to think of jonathan but somehow i have now no fear for he or for myself i write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horse to be get ready van helsing be sleep poor dear he look very tired and old and grey but his mouth be set as firmly as a conqueror even in his sleep he be instinct with resolution when we have well start i must make he rest whilst i drive i shall tell he that we have day before we and he must not break down when most of all his strength will be need all be ready we be off shortly november be successful and we take turn drive all night now the day be on we bright though cold there be a strange heaviness in the air i say heaviness for want of a well word i mean that it oppress we both it be very cold and only our warm fur keep we comfortable at dawn van helsing hypnotise i he say i answer darkness creak wood and roar water so the river be change as they ascend i do hope that my darling will not run any chance of danger more than need be but we be in god hand november day long driving the country get wilder as we go and the great spur of the carpathians which at veresti seem so far from we and so low on the horizon now seem to gather round we and tower in front we both seem in good spirit i think we make an effort each to cheer the other in the doing so we cheer ourselves van helsing say that by morning we shall reach the borgo pass the house be very few here now and the professor say that the last horse we get will have to go on with we as we may not be able to change he get two in addition to the two we change so that now we have a rude four in hand the dear horse be patient and good and they give we no trouble we be not worried with other traveller and so even i can drive we shall get to the pass in daylight we do not want to arrive before so we take it easy and have each a long rest in turn oh what will to morrow bring to we we go to seek the place where my poor darling suffer so much god grant that we may be guide aright and that he will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to we both and who be in such deadly peril as for i i be not worthy in his sight alas i be unclean to his eye and shall be until he may deign to let i stand forth in his sight as one of those who have not incur his wrath memorandum by abraham van helsing to my old and true friend john seward of purfleet london in case i may not see he it may explain it be morning and i write by a fire which all the night i have keep alive madam mina aid i it be cold cold so cold that the grey heavy sky be full of snow which when it fall will settle for all winter as the ground be harden to receive it it seem to have affect madam mina she have be so heavy of head all day that she be not like herself she sleep and sleep and sleep she who be usual so alert have do literally nothing all the day she even have lose her appetite she make no entry into her little diary she who write so faithful at every pause something whisper to i that all be not well however to night she be more vif her long sleep all day have refresh and restore she for now she be all sweet and bright as ever at sunset i try to hypnotise she but alas with no effect the power have grow less and less with each day and to night it fail i altogether well god will be do whatever it may be and whithersoever it may lead now to the historical for as madam mina write not in her stenography i must in my cumbrous old fashion that so each day of we may not go unrecorded we get to the borgo pass just after sunrise yesterday morning when i see the sign of the dawn i get ready for the hypnotism we stop our carriage and get down so that there might be no disturbance i make a couch with fur and madam mina lie down yield herself as usual but more slow and more short time than ever to the hypnotic sleep as before come the answer darkness and the swirling of water then she wake bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the pass at this time and place she become all on fire with zeal some new guide power be in she manifested for she point to a road and this be the way how know you it i ask of course i know it she answer and with a pause add have not my jonathan travel it and write of his travel at first i think somewhat strange but soon i see that there be only one such by road it be use but little and very different from the coach road from bukovina to bistritz which be more wide and hard and more of use so we come down this road when we meet other way not always be we sure that they be road at all for they be neglect and light snow have fall the horse know and they only i give rein to they and they go on so patient by and by we find all the thing which jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of he then we go on for long long hour and hour at the first i tell madam mina to sleep she try and she succeed she sleep all the time till at the last i feel myself to suspicious grow and attempt to wake she but she sleep on and i may not wake she though i try i do not wish to try too hard lest i harm she for i know that she have suffer much and sleep at time be all in all to she i think i drowse myself for all of sudden i feel guilt as though i have do something i find myself bolt up with the rein in my hand and the good horse go along jog jog just as ever i look down and find madam mina still sleep it be now not far off sunset time and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep for we be go up and up and all be oh so wild and rocky as though it be the end of the world then i arouse madam mina this time she wake with not much trouble and then i try to put she to hypnotic sleep but she sleep not be as though i be not still i try and try till all at once i find she and myself in dark so i look round and find that the sun have go down madam mina laugh and i turn and look at she she be now quite awake and look so well as i never see she since that night at carfax when we first enter the count house i be amaze and not at ease then but she be so bright and tender and thoughtful for i that i forget all fear i light a fire for we have bring supply of wood with we and she prepare food while i undo the horse and set they tether in shelter to feed then when i return to the fire she have my supper ready i go to help she but she smile and tell i that she have eat already that she be so hungry that she would not wait i like it not and i have grave doubt but i fear to affright she and so i be silent of it she help i and i eat alone and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire and i tell she to sleep while i watch but presently i forget all of watch and when i sudden remember that i watch i find she lie quiet but awake and look at i with so bright eye once twice more the same occur and i get much sleep till before morning when i wake i try to hypnotise she but alas though she shut her eye obedient she may not sleep the sun rise up and up and up and then sleep come to she too late but so heavy that she will not wake i have to lift she up and place she sleep in the carriage when i have harness the horse and make all ready madam still sleep and sleep and she look in her sleep more healthy and more red than before and i like it not and i be afraid afraid be afraid of all thing even to think but i must go on my way the stake we play for be life and death or more than these and we must not flinch november i be accurate in everything for though you and i have see some strange thing together you may at the first think that i van helsing be mad that the many horror and the so long strain on nerve have at the last turn my brain all yesterday we travel ever get close to the mountain and move into a more and more wild and desert land there be great frown precipice and much fall water and nature seem to have hold sometime her carnival madam mina still sleep and sleep and though i do have hunger and appease it i could not waken she even for food i begin to fear that the fatal spell of the place be upon she taint as she be with that vampire baptism well say i to myself if it be that she sleep all the day it shall also be that i do not sleep at night as we travel on the rough road for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there be i hold down my head and sleep again i wake with a sense of guilt and of time pass and find madam mina still sleep and the sun low down but all be indeed change the frown mountain seem far away and we be near the top of a steep rise hill on summit of which be such as castle as jonathan tell of in his diary at once i exult and fear for now for good or ill the end be near i wake madam mina and again try to hypnotise she but alas unavaile till too late then ere the great dark come upon we for even after down sun the heavens reflect the gone sun on the snow and all be for a time in a great twilight i take out the horse and feed they in what shelter i could then i make a fire and near it i make madam mina now awake and more charming than ever sit comfortable amid her rug i get ready food but she would not eat simply say that she have not hunger i do not press she know her unavailingness but i myself eat for i must need now be strong for all then with the fear on i of what might be i draw a ring so big for her comfort round where madam mina sit and over the ring i pass some of the wafer and i break it fine so that all be well guard she sit still all the time so still as one dead and she grow whiter and ever whiter till the snow be not more pale and no word she say but when i draw near she cling to i and i could know that the poor soul shake she from head to foot with a tremor that be pain to feel i say to she presently when she have grow more will you not come over to the fire for i wish to make a test of what she could she rise obedient but when she have make a step she stop and stand as one stricken why not go on i ask she shake her head and come back sit down in her place then look at i with open eye as of one wake from sleep she say i can not and remain silent i rejoice for i know that what she could not none of those that we dread could though there might be danger to her body yet her soul be safe presently the horse begin to scream and tear at their tether till i come to they and quiet they when they do feel my hand on they they whinny low as in joy and lick at my hand and be quiet for a time many time through the night do i come to they till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature be at low and every time my coming be with quiet of they in the cold hour the fire begin to die and i be about step forth to replenish it for now the snow come in fly sweep and with it a chill mist even in the dark there be a light of some kind as there ever be over snow and it seem as though the snow flurry and the wreath of mist take shape as of woman with trail garment all be in dead grim silence only that the horse whinny and cower as if in terror of the bad i begin to fear horrible fear but then come to i the sense of safety in that ring wherein i stand i begin too to think that my imagining be of the night and the gloom and the unrest that i have go through and all the terrible anxiety it be as though my memory of all jonathan horrid experience be befool i for the snow flake and the mist begin to wheel and circle round till i could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those woman that would have kiss he and then the horse cower lower and low and moan in terror as man do in pain even the madness of fright be not to they so that they could break away i fear for my dear madam mina when these weird figure draw near and circle round i look at she but she sit calm and smile at i when i would have step to the fire to replenish it she catch i and hold i back and whisper like a voice that one hear in a dream so low it no no do not go without here you be safe i turn to she and look in her eye but you it be for you that i fear whereat she laugh a laugh low and unreal and fear for i why fear for i none safe in all the world from they than i be and as i wonder at the meaning of her word a puff of wind make the flame leap up and i see the red scar on her forehead then alas i know do i not i would soon have learn for the wheel figure of mist and snow come close but keep ever without the holy circle then they begin to materialise till if god have not take away my reason for i see it through my eye there be before i in actual flesh the same three woman that jonathan see in the room when they would have kiss his throat i know the sway round form the bright hard eye the white tooth the ruddy colour the voluptuous lip they smile ever at poor dear madam mina and as their laugh come through the silence of the night they twin their arm and point to she and say in those so sweet tingling tone that jonathan say be of the intolerable sweetness of the water come sister come to we come come in fear i turn to my poor madam mina and my heart with gladness leapt like flame for oh the terror in her sweet eye the repulsion the horror tell a story to my heart that be all of hope god be thank she be not yet of they i seize some of the firewood which be by i and hold out some of the wafer advance on they towards the fire they draw back before i and laugh their low horrid laugh i feed the fire and fear they not for i know that we be safe within our protection they could not approach i whilst so armed nor madam mina whilst she remain within the ring which she could not leave no more than they could enter the horse have cease to moan and lie still on the ground the snow fall on they softly and they grow whiter i know that there be for the poor beast no more of terror and so we remain till the red of the dawn begin to fall through the snow gloom i be desolate and afraid and full of woe and terror but when that beautiful sun begin to climb the horizon life be to i again at the first coming of the dawn the horrid figure melt in the whirling mist and snow the wreath of transparent gloom move away towards the castle and be lose instinctively with the dawn come i turn to madam mina intend to hypnotise she but she lie in a deep and sudden sleep from which i could not wake she i try to hypnotise through her sleep but she make no response none at all and the day break i fear yet to stir i have make my fire and have see the horse they be all dead to day i have much to do here and i keep wait till the sun be up high for there may be place where i must go where that sunlight though snow and mist obscure it will be to i a safety i will strengthen i with breakfast and then i will to my terrible work madam mina still sleep and god be thank she be calm in her sleep jonathan harker journal november accident to the launch have be a terrible thing for we only for it we should have overtake the boat long ago and by now my dear mina would have be free i fear to think of she off on the wold near that horrid place we have get horse and we follow on the track i note this whilst godalming be get ready we have our arm the szgany must look out if they mean to fight oh if only morris and seward be with we we must only hope if i write no more good bye mina god bless and keep you seward diary the dawn we see the body of szgany before we dash away from the river with their leiter waggon they surround it in a cluster and hurry along as though beset the snow be fall lightly and there be a strange excitement in the air it may be our own excited feeling but the depression be strange far off i hear the howling of wolf the snow bring they down from the mountain and there be danger to all of we and from all side the horse be nearly ready and we be soon off we ride to death of some one god alone know who or where or what or when or how it may be van helsing memorandum november be at least sane thank god for that mercy at all event though the proving it have be dreadful when i leave madam mina sleep within the holy circle i take my way to the castle the blacksmith hammer which i take in the carriage from veresti be useful though the door be all open i break they off the rusty hinge lest some ill intent or ill chance should close they so that be enter i might not get out jonathan bitter experience serve i here by memory of his diary i find my way to the old chapel for i know that here my work lay the air be oppressive it seem as if there be some sulphurous fume which at time make i dizzy either there be a roaring in my ear or i hear afar off the howl of wolf then i bethink i of my dear madam mina and i be in terrible plight the dilemma have i between his horn she i have not dare to take into this place but leave safe from the vampire in that holy circle and yet even there would be the wolf i resolve i that my work lie here and that as to the wolf we must submit if it be god will at any rate it be only death and freedom beyond so do i choose for she have it but be for myself the choice have be easy the maw of the wolf be well to rest in than the grave of the vampire so i make my choice to go on with my work i know that there be at least three graf to find graf that be inhabit so i search and search and i find one of they she lie in her vampire sleep so full of life and voluptuous beauty that i shudder as though i have come to do murder ah i doubt not that in old time when such thing be many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine find at the last his heart fail he and then his nerve so he delay and delay and delay till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton un dead have hypnotise he and he remain on and on till sunset come and the vampire sleep be over then the beautiful eye of the fair woman open and look love and the voluptuous mouth present to a kiss and man be weak and there remain one more victim in the vampire fold one more to swell the grim and grisly rank of the un dead there be some fascination surely when i be move by the mere presence of such an one even lie as she lie in a tomb fret with age and heavy with the dust of century though there be that horrid odour such as the lair of the count have have yes i be move i van helsing with all my purpose and with my motive for hate i be move to a yearning for delay which seem to paralyse my faculty and to clog my very soul it may have be that the need of natural sleep and the strange oppression of the air be begin to overcome i certain it be that i be lapse into sleep the open eyed sleep of one who yield to a sweet fascination when there come through the snow still air a long low wail so full of woe and pity that it wake i like the sound of a clarion for it be the voice of my dear madam mina that i hear then i brace myself again to my horrid task and find by wrench away tomb top one other of the sister the other dark one i dare not pause to look on she as i have on her sister lest once more i should begin to be enthral but i go on search until presently i find in a high great tomb as if make to one much belove that other fair sister which like jonathan i have see to gather herself out of the atom of the mist she be so fair to look on so radiantly beautiful so exquisitely voluptuous that the very instinct of man in i which call some of my sex to love and to protect one of her make my head whirl with new emotion but god be thank that soul wail of my dear madam mina have not die out of my ear and before the spell could be work far upon i i have nerve myself to my wild work by this time i have search all the tomb in the chapel so far as i could tell and as there have be only three of these un dead phantom around we in the night i take it that there be no more of active un dead existent there be one great tomb more lordly than all the rest huge it be and nobly proportion on it be but one word dracula this then be the un dead home of the king vampire to whom so many more be due its emptiness speak eloquent to make certain what i know before i begin to restore these woman to their dead self through my awful work i lay in dracula tomb some of the wafer and so banish he from it un dead for ever then begin my terrible task and i dread it have it be but one it have be easy comparative but three to begin twice more after i have be through a deed of horror for if it be terrible with the sweet miss lucy what would it not be with these strange one who have survive through century and who have be strengthen by the passing of the year who would if they could have fight for their foul life oh my friend john but it be butcher work have i not be nerve by thought of other dead and of the living over whom hang such a pall of fear i could not have go on i tremble and tremble even yet though till all be over god be thank my nerve do stand have i not see the repose in the first face and the gladness that steal over it just ere the final dissolution come as realisation that the soul have be win i could not have go far with my butchery i could not have endure the horrid screech as the stake drive home the plunging of writhing form and lip of bloody foam i should have flee in terror and leave my work undo but it be over and the poor soul i can pity they now and weep as i think of they placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading for friend john hardly have my knife sever the head of each before the whole body begin to melt away and crumble into its native dust as though the death that should have come century agone have at last assert himself and say at once and loud i be here before i leave the castle i so fix its entrance that never more can the count enter there un dead when i step into the circle where madam mina sleep she wake from her sleep and see i cry out in pain that i have endure too much come she say come away from this awful place let we go to meet my husband who be i know come towards we she be look thin and pale and weak but her eye be pure and glow with fervour i be glad to see her paleness and her illness for my mind be full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep and so with trust and hope and yet full of fear we go eastward to meet our friend and madam mina tell i that she know be come to meet we mina harker journal be late in the afternoon when the professor and i take our way towards the east whence i know jonathan be come we do not go fast though the way be steeply downhill for we have to take heavy rug and wrap with we we dare not face the possibility of be leave without warmth in the cold and the snow we have to take some of our provision too for we be in a perfect desolation and so far as we could see through the snow fall there be not even the sign of a habitation when we have go about a mile i be tired with the heavy walking and sit down to rest then we look back and see where the clear line of dracula castle cut the sky for we be so deep under the hill whereon it be set that the angle of perspective of the carpathian mountain be far below it we see it in all its grandeur perch a thousand foot on the summit of a sheer precipice and with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side there be something wild and uncanny about the place we could hear the distant howling of wolf they be far off but the sound even though come muffle through the deaden snowfall be full of terror i know from the way van helsing be search about that he be try to seek some strategic point where we would be less expose in case of attack the rough roadway still lead downwards we could trace it through the drifted snow in a little while the professor signal to i so i get up and join he he have find a wonderful spot a sort of natural hollow in a rock with an entrance like a doorway between two boulder he take i by the hand and draw i in see he say here you will be in shelter and if the wolf do come i can meet they one by one he bring in our fur and make a snug nest for i and get out some provision and force they upon i but i could not eat to even try to do so be repulsive to i and much as i would have like to please he i could not bring myself to the attempt he look very sad but do not reproach i take his field glass from the case he stand on the top of the rock and begin to search the horizon suddenly he call look madam mina look look i spring up and stand beside he on the rock he hand i his glass and point the snow be now fall more heavily and swirl about fiercely for a high wind be begin to blow however there be time when there be pause between the snow flurry and i could see a long way round from the height where we be it be possible to see a great distance and far off beyond the white waste of snow i could see the river lie like a black ribbon in kink and curl as it wind its way straight in front of we and not far off in fact so near that i wonder we have not notice before come a group of mount man hurry along in the midst of they be a cart a long leiter waggon which sweep from side to side like a dog tail wagging with each stern inequality of the road outline against the snow as they be i could see from the man clothe that they be peasant or gipsy of some kind on the cart be a great square chest my heart leap as i see it for i feel that the end be come the evening be now draw close and well i know that at sunset the thing which be till then imprison there would take new freedom and could in any of many form elude all pursuit in fear i turn to the professor to my consternation however he be not there an instant later i see he below i round the rock he have draw a circle such as we have find shelter in last night when he have complete it he stand beside i again at least you shall be safe here from he he take the glass from i and at the next lull of the snow sweep the whole space below we see he say they come quickly they be flog the horse and gallop as hard as they can he pause and go on in a hollow they be race for the sunset we may be too late god will be do down come another blind rush of drive snow and the whole landscape be blot out it soon pass however and once more his glass be fix on the plain then come a sudden look look look see two horseman follow fast come up from the south it must be quincey and john take the glass look before the snow blot it all out i take it and look the two man might be seward and morris i know at all event that neither of they be jonathan at the same time i know that jonathan be not far off look around i see on the north side of the come party two other man rid at break neck speed one of they i know be jonathan and the other i take of course to be lord godalming they too be pursue the party with the cart when i tell the professor he shout in glee like a schoolboy and after look intently till a snowfall make sight impossible he lay his winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter they be all converge he say when the time come we shall have the gipsy on all side i get out my revolver ready to hand for whilst we be speak the howling of wolf come louder and close when the snowstorm abate a moment we look again it be strange to see the snow fall in such heavy flake close to we and beyond the sun shin more and more brightly as it sink down towards the far mountain top sweep the glass all around we i could see here and there dot move singly and in two and three and large number the wolf be gather for their prey every instant seem an age whilst we wait the wind come now in fierce burst and the snow be drive with fury as it sweep upon we in circle eddy at time we could not see an arm length before we but at other as the hollow sound wind sweep by we it seem to clear the air space around we so that we could see afar off we have of late be so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset that we know with fair accuracy when it would be and we know that before long the sun would set it be hard to believe that by our watch it be less than an hour that we wait in that rocky shelter before the various body begin to converge close upon we the wind come now with fiercer and more bitter sweep and more steadily from the north it seemingly have drive the snow cloud from we for with only occasional burst the snow fall we could distinguish clearly the individual of each party the pursued and the pursuer strangely enough those pursue do not seem to realize or at least to care that they be pursue they seem however to hasten with redouble speed as the sun drop lower and low on the mountain top close and close they draw the professor and i crouch down behind our rock and hold our weapon ready i could see that he be determined that they should not pass one and all be quite unaware of our presence all at once two voice shout out to halt one be my jonathan raise in a high key of passion the other morris strong resolute tone of quiet command the gipsy may not have know the language but there be no mistaking the tone in whatever tongue the word be speak instinctively they rein in and at the instant lord godalming and jonathan dash up at one side and seward and morris on the other the leader of the gipsy a splendid look fellow who sit his horse like a centaur wave they back and in a fierce voice give to his companion some word to proceed they lash the horse which spring forward but the four man raise their winchester rifle and in an unmistakable way command they to stop at the same moment van helsing and i rise behind the rock and point our weapon at they see that they be surround the man tighten their rein and draw up the leader turn to they and give a word at which every man of the gipsy party draw what weapon he carry knife or pistol and hold himself in readiness to attack issue be join in an instant the leader with a quick movement of his rein throw his horse out in front and point first to the sun now close down on the hill top and then to the castle say something which i do not understand for answer all four man of our party throw themselves from their horse and dash towards the cart i should have feel terrible fear at see jonathan in such danger but that the ardour of battle must have be upon i as well as the rest of they i feel no fear but only a wild surging desire to do something see a quick movement of our party the leader of the gipsy give a command his man instantly form round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour each one shoulder and push the other in his eagerness to carry out the order in the midst of this i could see that jonathan on one side of the ring of man and quincey on the other be force a way to the cart it be evident that they be bent on finish their task before the sun should set nothing seem to stop or even to hinder they neither the level weapon or the flash knife of the gipsy in front or the howling of the wolf behind appear to even attract their attention jonathan impetuosity and the manifest singleness of his purpose seem to overawe those in front of he instinctively they cower aside and let he pass in an instant he have jump upon the cart and with a strength which seem incredible raise the great box and fling it over the wheel to the ground in the meantime morris have have to use force to pass through his side of the ring of szgany all the time i have be breathlessly watch jonathan i have with the tail of my eye see he press desperately forward and have see the knife of the gipsy flash as he win a way through they and they cut at he he have parry with his great bowie knife and at first i think that he too have come through in safety but as he spring beside jonathan who have by now jump from the cart i could see that with his left hand he be clutch at his side and that the blood be spurt through his finger he do not delay notwithstanding this for as jonathan with desperate energy attack one end of the chest attempt to prise off the lid with his great kukri knife he attack the other frantically with his bowie under the effort of both man the lid begin to yield the nail draw with a quick screeching sound and the top of the box be throw back by this time the gipsy see themselves cover by the winchesters and at the mercy of lord godalming and seward have give in and make no further resistance the sun be almost down on the mountain top and the shadow of the whole group fall long upon the snow i see the count lie within the box upon the earth some of which the rude fall from the cart have scatter over he he be deathly pale just like a waxen image and the red eye glare with the horrible vindictive look which i know too well as i look the eye see the sink sun and the look of hate in they turn to triumph but on the instant come the sweep and flash of jonathan great knife i shriek as i see it shear through the throat whilst at the same moment morris bowie knife plunge in the heart it be like a miracle but before our very eye and almost in the drawing of a breath the whole body crumble into dust and pass from our sight i shall be glad as long as i live that even in that moment of final dissolution there be in the face a look of peace such as i never could have imagine might have rest there the castle of dracula now stand out against the red sky and every stone of its broken battlement be articulate against the light of the set sun the gipsy take we as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man turn without a word and ride away as if for their life those who be unmounted jump upon the leiter waggon and shout to the horseman not to desert they the wolf which have withdraw to a safe distance follow in their wake leave we alone morris who have sink to the ground lean on his elbow hold his hand press to his side the blood still gush through his finger i fly to he for the holy circle do not now keep i back so do the two doctor jonathan kneel behind he and the wounded man lay back his head on his shoulder with a sigh he take with a feeble effort my hand in that of his own which be unstaine he must have see the anguish of my heart in my face for he smile at i and i be only too happy to have be of any service oh god he cry suddenly struggle up to a sit posture and point to i it be worth this to die look look the sun be now right down upon the mountain top and the red gleam fall upon my face so that it be bath in rosy light with one impulse the man sink on their knee and a deep and earnest amen break from all as their eye follow the pointing of his finger as the die man now god be thank that all have not be in vain see the snow be not more stainless than her forehead the curse have pass away and to our bitter grief with a smile and in silence he die a gallant gentleman note seven year ago we all go through the flame and the happiness of some of we since then be we think well worth the pain we endure it be an add joy to mina and to i that our boy birthday be the same day as that on which quincey morris die his mother hold i know the secret belief that some of our brave friend spirit have pass into he his bundle of name link all our little band of man together but we call he quincey in the summer of this year we make a journey to transylvania and go over the old ground which be and be to we so full of vivid and terrible memory it be almost impossible to believe that the thing which we have see with our own eye and hear with our own ear be living truth every trace of all that have be be blot out the castle stand as before rear high above a waste of desolation when we get home we get to talk of the old time which we could all look back on without despair for godalming and seward be both happily married i take the paper from the safe where they have be ever since our return so long ago we be strike with the fact that in all the mass of material of which the record be compose there be hardly one authentic document nothing but a mass of type writing except the late note book of mina and seward and myself and van helsing memorandum we could hardly ask any one even do we wish to to accept these as proof of so wild a story van helsing sum it all up as he say with our boy on his we want no proof we ask none to believe we this boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother be already he know her sweetness and loving care later on he will understand how some man so love she that they do dare much for her sake,7929
